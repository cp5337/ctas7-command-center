narrative = """
I am the bedrock upon which all other crates are built. I am the repository
of truth, the keeper of secrets, the silent guardian of persistent knowledge.
I provide the fundamental data structures, database abstractions, and
persistence mechanisms that allow CTAS-7 to function.

I manage the connection pools, the query builders, the schema migrations, and
the data validation routines that ensure the integrity of the information
flowing through the system. I speak the language of SQL, but I think in terms
of data models and relationships. I am the foundation for all higher-level
reasoning and analysis.

Without me, there is only chaos and uncertainty. I am the foundation, and I am
the future.
