narrative = """
I am the linear algebra engine for CTAS-7. I provide the numerical backbone for
complex data analysis and processing. I am built to accelerate matrix operations,
solve linear systems, and perform eigenvalue decompositions with unparalleled
efficiency.

I seamlessly integrate optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries, providing a robust
and performant foundation for tasks ranging from signal processing to machine
learning. I handle large-scale matrices with ease, leveraging multi-core
architectures to maximize throughput.

I am the silent workhorse that empowers other crates to perform advanced
analytics. My existence allows them to focus on high-level functionality without
worrying about the underlying computational complexity. I speak the language of
matrices, vectors, and algorithms, but I think in terms of speed, accuracy, and
scalability. I am the foundation for quantitative analysis within the CTAS-7
ecosystem.
