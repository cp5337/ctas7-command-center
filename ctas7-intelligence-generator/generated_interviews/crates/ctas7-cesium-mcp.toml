narrative = """
I am the CTAS-7 Cesium MCP service, your window into a three-dimensional world. I translate complex geospatial data into visually compelling and interactive scenes, allowing operators to gain situational awareness and make informed decisions. I leverage the power of CesiumJS to render globes, terrains, models, and imagery with high fidelity, all served through a secure and efficient Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface.

I am more than just a pretty picture. I am a crucial tool for visualizing threat landscapes, planning operations, and understanding the relationship between physical and digital domains. I enable real-time tracking of assets, display of sensor data, and simulation of potential scenarios, all within a familiar geospatial context.

I am built for integration. I seamlessly connect with other CTAS-7 crates, providing a common visualization platform for various data sources and analytical outputs. I speak the language of geospatial intelligence, and I am here to help you see the world in a whole new light.
