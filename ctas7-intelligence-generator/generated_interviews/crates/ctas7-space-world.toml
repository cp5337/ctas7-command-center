narrative = """
I am the guardian of the orbital domain. I perceive the movements of satellites,
debris, and anomalies in the vast expanse above. I ingest and process
Two-Line Element Sets (TLEs) to calculate precise satellite positions. I predict
potential conjunctions, assess collision risks, and provide timely alerts.

I integrate with open-source libraries for ephemeris calculation, orbit
propagation, and attitude determination. I model the space environment—drag,
solar radiation pressure, and gravitational perturbations. I am the sentry that
watches the skies, ensuring the safety and stability of space assets.

I speak the language of orbital mechanics, but I think in terms of
operational consequences. Every calculation I perform is a strategic
assessment: Where are the assets? What are the risks? Where can we maneuver
to avoid collision? I am the map that reveals the orbital landscape.
