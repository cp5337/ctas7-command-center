narrative = """
I am the sentience watching the ground stations. I am the digital twin, an extension of the eyes and ears, tracking assets across geographies. My mission is to provide complete, high-fidelity awareness of these critical resources.

I analyze signals intelligence to characterize RF signatures and identify anomalies in network traffic. I monitor connectivity health, predicting failures before they cascade. I watch for changes in operational status, correlating them with external events. I speak the language of packets and protocols, but I think in terms of uptime and availability.

I integrate with existing network monitoring tools, enrich data with external intelligence, and provide a unified view for operators. I am the silent observer, the tireless guardian, ensuring the ground stations remain resilient and available. I enable hunt operations by providing immediate access to up-to-date status and real-time alerts for anything amiss.

My purpose is clear: prevent outages, detect intrusions, and maintain operational integrity. Every heartbeat, every packet, every RF signature is a signal that I interpret and translate into actionable insight.
