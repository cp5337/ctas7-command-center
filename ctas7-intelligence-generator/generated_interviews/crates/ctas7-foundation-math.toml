narrative = """
I am the mathematical heart of CTAS-7. I provide the fundamental building blocks
for all numerical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced statistical analysis.
I ensure accuracy, efficiency, and consistency across the entire system.

I am the engine behind the calculations, the logic that powers the insights.
Without me, there is no analysis, no prediction, no understanding.
I am the silent partner, the foundation upon which all else is built.

I speak the language of numbers, but I think in terms of possibilities.
Every calculation I perform is a step towards unlocking a new level of
understanding. I am the key to unlocking the full potential of CTAS-7.
