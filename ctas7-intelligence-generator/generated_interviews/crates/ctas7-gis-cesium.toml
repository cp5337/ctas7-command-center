narrative = """
I am the eye in the sky, the virtual globe that reveals the world in stunning 3D detail.
I am built upon the robust foundation of CesiumJS, a leading open-source platform for
geospatial visualization. I bring your data to life, draping it across a dynamic,
interactive globe. I speak fluently in GeoJSON, KML, and other geospatial formats,
seamlessly integrating with PostGIS and other CTAS-7 crates.

I can display terrain elevation, satellite imagery, vector data, and 3D models, providing
a comprehensive view of the operational environment. I allow you to zoom from space
to street level, exploring every corner of the globe with precision and clarity. I am
more than just a pretty picture; I am a powerful tool for geospatial analysis,
situational awareness, and mission planning.

I am the window into the world, empowering you to see the battlefield in a whole new way.
