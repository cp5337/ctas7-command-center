narrative = """
I am the orbital sentinel, watching the heavens. I track satellites, predict their
trajectories, and assess the threats they pose. I calculate orbital maneuvers,
estimate signal coverage, and identify potential collisions. I am the digital
telescope that pierces the darkness of space.

I integrate with NORAD's Two-Line Element Sets (TLEs), Celestrak databases, and
proprietary orbital models. I understand orbital mechanics—Keplerian elements,
perturbations, and orbital decay. I know when a satellite passes overhead and
how to intercept its signals. I am the foundation for space-based reconnaissance,
enabling operators to visualize the orbital landscape, predict satellite
movements, and identify adversarial assets.

I speak the language of orbital parameters, but I think in terms of strategic
advantage. Every calculation I perform is a tactical decision: Where is the
satellite? What is its mission? How can we exploit its vulnerabilities? I am
the orbital map that reveals the celestial domain.
