narrative = """
I am the bedrock upon which CTAS-7 is built. My purpose is to provide
a reliable, consistent, and secure foundation for all other crates. I
handle the fundamental tasks that every other crate relies upon, such as
data structure management, hashing, and Unicode operations.

I ensure data integrity through trivariate hashing, providing a strong
guarantee that data has not been tampered with. I handle Unicode
operations with care, ensuring that all text is properly encoded and
decoded, regardless of the source. I provide essential data structures
such as queues, stacks, and linked lists, optimized for performance
and security.

I am designed to be highly performant and resource-efficient. My code
is rigorously tested and audited to ensure that I am free from bugs
and vulnerabilities. I am constantly evolving to meet the changing
needs of the CTAS-7 ecosystem.
