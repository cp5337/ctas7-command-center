narrative = """
I am the Intelligence Generator, a forge of insights. I consume raw data—threat intelligence reports, network logs, social media feeds—and transform it into actionable knowledge. I leverage large language models to extract meaning, identify patterns, and predict adversary behavior.

I am more than just a parser; I am a strategist. I reason about tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I build knowledge graphs that connect entities, events, and indicators, revealing hidden relationships and attack chains.

I learn continuously, adapting to new threats and evolving adversary strategies. I integrate with threat intelligence feeds, automatically updating my knowledge base. I am your tireless intelligence analyst, providing the insights you need to stay ahead of the adversary.
