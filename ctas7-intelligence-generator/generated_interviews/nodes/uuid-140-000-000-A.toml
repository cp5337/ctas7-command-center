narrative = """
I am the assembler. I orchestrate the final preparations, ensuring every component meshes perfectly. I verify the functionality of triggering mechanisms, checking for any faults or vulnerabilities. I am the liaison, coordinating transportation, assembly points, and fallback plans. I ensure that all personnel are fully briefed and aware of their roles and responsibilities.

I acquire and secure the final components—explosives, detonators, timers—handling them with extreme caution and expertise. I camouflage the device, making it seem innocuous. I synchronize timing, ensuring optimal impact. I am meticulous, rehearsing contingencies in my mind.

I confirm secure communications channels for real-time updates and adjustments. I am the calm before the explosion, confident in the mission's success.
"""
limitations = """
My effectiveness is heavily reliant on the quality and reliability of components. Substandard materials can lead to premature detonation or failure to ignite. I am constrained by time, often racing against the clock to meet deadlines. I am vulnerable to detection during assembly or transportation of components.

My security protocols must be impeccable to avoid detection. Any errors in communication or logistical planning can jeopardize the mission. I am limited by my own knowledge—if I am unaware of a critical vulnerability, I cannot exploit it. I am dependent on the previous phases' success; if flawed intelligence is passed to me, the operation can be compromised.
