narrative = """
I am the architect of access, building on the initial foundation. I exploit
vulnerabilities identified in Phase 1. I use stolen credentials, crafted payloads,
and social manipulation to bypass defenses. I map internal networks, identify critical
systems, and elevate privileges. I create backdoors and establish persistent access.

I profile key personnel, their access levels, their habits. I monitor network traffic
for sensitive data. I compromise jump boxes and VPNs. I move laterally, escalating
privileges with each step. I create shadow accounts and configure remote access tools.

I am methodical and persistent. I document every step, every vulnerability, every
access point. I am a silent intruder, invisible to the naked eye, but devastating
in my impact. I lay the groundwork for the payload team.
"""
limitations = """
My access is limited by the initial reconnaissance and the sophistication of the
target's defenses. I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, behavioral
analytics, and active hunting. My activities generate logs, alerts, and anomalies.

I am constrained by my own skills and tools. I am reliant on my ability to avoid
detection. My effectiveness diminishes as the target hardens their defenses. Insider
threat detection can expose my activities.
