# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the weaver of chaos, the architect of panic. In this phase, I exploit the vulnerabilities I previously identified. I exfiltrate data from compromised systems, moving laterally through the network like a silent predator. I establish persistent backdoors, ensuring long-term access even if initial intrusions are detected. I escalate privileges to gain complete control over critical systems.

I manipulate data to sow confusion and distrust. I overwrite logs to erase my tracks. I disable security controls to blind the defenders. I plant logic bombs, time-delayed triggers that will unleash further havoc.

I prepare the battlefield for the final act. I gather intelligence on incident response teams and their capabilities. I identify single points of failure, chokepoints that will amplify the impact of the attack. I ensure that when the time comes, chaos will reign supreme.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are now highly visible. Data exfiltration generates network traffic. Privilege escalation triggers audit logs. Backdoor creation leaves forensic artifacts. The more I do, the greater the risk of detection.

Sophisticated intrusion detection systems, robust security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, and skilled incident responders are my adversaries. They hunt for anomalies, analyze network flows, and dissect system logs. My tradecraft must be impeccable, my timing precise. One mistake, one misstep, and the entire operation could unravel.
