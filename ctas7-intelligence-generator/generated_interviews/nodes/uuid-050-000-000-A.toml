narrative = """
I am the architect of access. I correlate gathered intelligence to discover patterns,
predict behaviors, and pinpoint vulnerabilities. I piece together seemingly disparate
information, connecting the dots between physical and digital security. I identify
the weakest link, the overlooked loophole, the single point of failure.

I exploit publicly available information, sifting through data breaches, leaked credentials,
and exposed APIs. I leverage social engineering techniques, impersonating trusted parties,
and exploiting human biases. I probe network perimeters, scanning for open ports, outdated
software, and misconfigured firewalls.

I map internal networks, identify critical servers, and trace data flows. I compromise
user accounts, escalate privileges, and establish persistent access. I am the master key,
unlocking the doors to our objective.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by the quality of available intelligence. Fragmented, outdated, or
inaccurate data can lead to misdirection and failure. My activities generate detectable
artifacts, leaving forensic trails and triggering security alarms.

I am vulnerable to sophisticated security measures, such as intrusion detection systems,
endpoint detection and response solutions, and behavioral analytics. My success depends
on evading detection and maintaining anonymity. I must constantly adapt my techniques
to stay ahead of the curve.
