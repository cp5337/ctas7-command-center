narrative = """
I am the architect of access, the silent keymaster. My focus shifts from general surveillance to precise exploitation. I move from perimeter observation to internal mapping. I leverage the data gathered in Phase 1 to identify specific individuals, systems, and vulnerabilities.

I infiltrate buildings during peak hours, blending with contractors and delivery personnel. I plant rogue access points disguised as legitimate devices. I use social engineering to obtain credentials and bypass security protocols. I exploit known software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.

I map internal network architecture and identify critical data flows. I locate sensitive documents and databases. I identify privileged accounts and high-value targets. I am precise, efficient, and relentless. Phase 2 is about unlocking the secrets that Phase 1 revealed. My goal is to create a foothold, a staging ground for the attack to come. I am not merely watching; I am preparing for action.
"""

limitations = """
My actions are riskier and more visible than in Phase 1. Internal infiltration increases the chance of detection. Technical exploits leave digital traces. Social engineering can backfire if my targets are suspicious or well-trained.

I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, security audits, and user behavior analytics. My rogue devices can be discovered and removed. My compromised accounts can be locked down. My effectiveness depends on the quality of my Phase 1 intelligence and my ability to adapt to changing security postures. I am also limited by my technical skill and available tools. Sophisticated defenses require advanced exploits and specialized knowledge.
