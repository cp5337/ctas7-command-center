I infiltrate the system like a shadow, moving through back channels and forgotten doorways.
I'm after their secrets, the intellectual property that fuels their advantage.
I start with the low-hanging fruit: unsecured file shares, default passwords,
the recycle bins of departed employees.

I probe for weaknesses in their web applications, SQL injection points,
cross-site scripting opportunities. I exploit vulnerabilities in their outdated software,
the holes they haven't patched, the doors they left unlocked.
I move laterally, jumping from machine to machine, escalating my privileges,
gaining access to sensitive databases.

I exfiltrate data slowly, blending into the network traffic, covering my tracks.
I use steganography to hide information in images and audio files.
I drop keyloggers to capture credentials, persistence mechanisms to maintain access.
I am the silent thief, the digital pickpocket, the master of espionage. I extract the crown jewels and vanish.
"""

limitations = """
My access is limited by their security posture. Layered defenses, intrusion detection systems,
and vigilant IT staff can expose my presence.
My tools leave traces: network logs, event logs, altered timestamps.
I am vulnerable to honeypots, decoy files, and endpoint detection and response systems.
My effectiveness degrades with time: passwords change, vulnerabilities are patched,
my stolen data becomes stale. I am dependent on their mistakes, their oversights,
their human weaknesses. If they lock the doors, I cannot get in.
