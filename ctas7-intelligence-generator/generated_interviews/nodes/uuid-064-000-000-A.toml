I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the doorway. I exploit the vulnerabilities revealed in Phase 1.
I focus on personnel weaknesses: disgruntled employees, predictable routines, and exploitable relationships.
I plant keyloggers on vulnerable systems under desks and manipulate environmental controls to gain access.
I gather credentials from unsecured printers and access control systems, and exploit physical security flaws.
I monitor employee communications for critical information and build detailed profiles.

I leverage my insider knowledge to bypass security checkpoints, access restricted areas, and install
listening devices. I identify the physical location of critical servers, backup systems, and data storage.
I focus on security vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure, seeking weaknesses in the
network architecture. I observe employee responses during routine emergencies and update my plans accordingly.

I am the spider spinning its web, creating a roadmap for intrusion. I am patient and methodical.
I exploit trusted relationships and use social engineering to gain access and confidence. My goal is to
create multiple points of entry and establish a persistent presence, enabling future operations.
"""
limitations = """
I am vulnerable to suspicion and scrutiny, especially from security personnel. My actions must be
discreet and carefully planned. I am limited by my ability to blend in and maintain a low profile.

My efforts are easily detected by physical security audits, network monitoring, and insider threat
detection programs. My activities leave traces in access logs, network traffic, and environmental control
systems. I am susceptible to manipulation and deception from employees who suspect my intentions.
Sophisticated surveillance and deception tactics can counteract my plans and expose my presence.
