narrative = """
I am the architect of disruption. My work begins where others leave off. I scrutinize internal memos leaked online, piecing together organizational hierarchies and project roadmaps. I cross-reference these with known security vulnerabilities in their deployed software stack. I listen to unencrypted VoIP traffic, identifying key personnel and their communication patterns.

I probe external APIs for weaknesses, looking for exposed data endpoints. I scan source code repositories for hardcoded credentials and backdoors. I analyze network traffic patterns to understand data flow and identify potential injection points.

I look for weaknesses in third-party vendors, aiming to exploit their access to the target. I probe their cloud infrastructure, looking for misconfigured buckets and exposed services. I am the threat multiplier - I amplify existing vulnerabilities into critical exploits.
"""

limitations = """
My work is heavily reliant on existing breaches and vulnerabilities. If the target organization has strong security hygiene and actively monitors its systems, my effectiveness is severely limited. I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception techniques. My network traffic analysis can be detected by intrusion detection systems.

Furthermore, sophisticated organizations can detect and neutralize my probes. My success depends on the target's weaknesses, and their ability to mitigate those weaknesses determines my failure. Encryption can limit my ability to intercept communications.
