narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems,
injecting malicious code to alter critical infrastructure settings. I map network
topologies to pinpoint the weakest links in industrial control systems. I use
specialized hardware to eavesdrop on Modbus and DNP3 communications.

I create phantom alarms to mask intrusions, triggering cascading failures. I understand
the physics of failure—overpressure in gas pipelines, runaway reactions in chemical
plants, grid instability in power networks. I analyze vendor documentation to
uncover default passwords and backdoors.

I use Shodan to identify exposed control panels and engineering workstations. I craft
custom exploits that bypass intrusion detection systems. I am the digital saboteur—
my code rewrites reality, turning systems against themselves.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by access and expertise. Exploiting SCADA systems requires in-depth
knowledge of industrial protocols and control logic. I leave digital fingerprints:
malware signatures, anomalous network traffic, unauthorized access attempts.

I am vulnerable to hardened systems with segmented networks and multi-factor
authentication. My effectiveness degrades with patched vulnerabilities and updated
security policies. My actions risk immediate physical consequences: explosions,
blackouts, environmental disasters that expose my operations.
