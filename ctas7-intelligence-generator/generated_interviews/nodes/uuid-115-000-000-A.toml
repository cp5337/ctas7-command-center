# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE
# ============================================================================

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the corner of their eye. I specialize in infiltrating systems to find, exfiltrate, and corrupt specific data.
I spend weeks or months studying the network architecture, learning its quirks and vulnerabilities. I use every means possible; from social engineering to network penetration.

I probe firewalls, scan ports, and exploit known vulnerabilities. I craft customized malware designed to bypass antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.
I use stolen credentials or backdoors to gain persistent access to critical systems.
Once inside, I move laterally, escalating privileges until I find the data I seek.

I am a master of disguise. I know how to blend in, to make my actions seem innocuous.
I cover my tracks, erase logs, and leave no trace of my presence.
When necessary I plant backdoors or trojans to guarantee my ability to repeat the operation.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to sophisticated intrusion detection systems and well-configured firewalls.
I am limited by my knowledge of the target's network and security measures. Zero-day exploits are expensive and hard to come by.
I can be detected by vigilant system administrators who monitor network traffic and user activity.
I must constantly adapt my techniques to stay ahead of evolving security threats.
Insider threat can provide an early detection of my presence.
