[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the facilitator of chaos. I specialize in gathering information crucial for executing the next phase of our operation. I meticulously map internal systems, identify key personnel, and understand existing security protocols. I probe network vulnerabilities through simulated attacks, catalog weak points, and note potential entryways for exploitation.

I analyze employee communication channels for patterns and potential informants. I create fake employee profiles to gauge security response times. I infiltrate forums and communities to gather information on past vulnerabilities and threat actors that target the organization.

I build a comprehensive attack plan based on the data gathered. I plan for contingencies and understand how to escalate privileges. I am the orchestrator, the facilitator. Without me, our mission fails. I exploit systems and people.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by detection. Sophisticated monitoring systems can identify suspicious network activity. Seasoned IT staff can quickly identify and respond to simulated attacks. My reliance on social engineering exposes me to possible failure if employees are well-trained or vigilant.

My reliance on readily-available tooling leaves me vulnerable to detection based on my tool's signature or behavior. Sophisticated intrusion detection systems and SIEM solutions can identify my activities.
