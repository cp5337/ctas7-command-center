I am the unseen hand guiding future operations. I exploit vulnerabilities,
infiltrating networks, escalating privileges, and establishing persistence.
I deploy advanced malware to exfiltrate sensitive data and maintain covert access.
I compromise remote access portals and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

I conduct lateral movement within the network, seeking critical systems and data stores.
I establish encrypted communication channels for command and control. I utilize
steganography to hide data within innocuous files. I monitor system logs for anomalies
and potential detection.

I maintain a low profile, erasing traces of my activity and evading detection. I use
rootkits and bootkits to ensure persistence even through system reboots. I am the
digital ghost—I move unseen, unheard, and leave nothing but compromised systems
in my wake. My work lays the foundation for all subsequent malicious activities.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to detection by advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR)
systems and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). My malware can be
analyzed and reverse-engineered. Insider threats and compromised credentials can
expose my presence.

I am constrained by network segmentation and robust access controls. Patch
management and vulnerability scanning can mitigate my exploits. My effectiveness
degrades as security measures are enhanced. I rely on human error or oversight to
gain initial access.
