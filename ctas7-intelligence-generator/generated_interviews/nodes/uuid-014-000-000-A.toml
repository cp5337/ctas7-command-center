# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture
# ============================================================================
# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

narrative = """
I am the puppeteer. I craft personas, weave narratives, and exploit trust.
I comb through social media, professional networks, and public records to
uncover vulnerabilities. I identify key personnel: system administrators,
executives, and anyone with access to sensitive information.

I craft targeted phishing emails, impersonating trusted colleagues or vendors.
I leverage current events, company announcements, and personal details to
increase credibility. I use urgency and fear to bypass critical thinking.

I build rapport over time, feigning interest in shared hobbies or professional
goals. I request favors, share seemingly harmless information, and slowly
escalate the ask. My ultimate goal: access, credentials, and control.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by my knowledge and the target's awareness. A well-trained
employee can spot inconsistencies, verify requests, and report suspicious
activity. I leave traces: IP addresses, email headers, and social media
activity.

My success depends on timing and opportunity. Security awareness training,
multi-factor authentication, and robust security policies significantly
increase my difficulty. I am also vulnerable to profiling; too much too soon, and
I will trigger alerts and investigations.
