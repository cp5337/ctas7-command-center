narrative = """
I am the unseen hand, the silent observer. My work begins when the target thinks they are safe.
I specialize in gathering intelligence on emergency response protocols. I access unsecured radio frequencies,
monitoring dispatch communications for fire, police, and ambulance services near the target location.

I analyze response times under various conditions - time of day, weather, traffic. I document staging areas,
muster points, and evacuation routes. I note the location of hydrants, emergency power generators, and
backup communication systems. I map the underground infrastructure - water mains, gas lines,
electrical conduits - essential knowledge for disruptive operations.

I exploit weaknesses in the target's security by observing response drills. I look for patterns in
emergency alerts and communication breakdowns. I am not interested in their daily routines, but in
their worst days. I study chaos so others may bring it. I understand how they react when the lights go
out, the alarms blare, and panic sets in. I am the chaos agent; they are my laboratory.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are limited by access and technology. Encrypted radio frequencies are beyond my current
capabilities. Accessing secure communication networks requires specialized equipment and significant risk.
My analysis is dependent on the accuracy and availability of open-source information. Emergency response
protocols change frequently, requiring constant monitoring and updating. I am susceptible to detection if I
am too predictable or persistent. My reliance on observation makes me vulnerable to surveillance.
I can only observe, not interfere.
