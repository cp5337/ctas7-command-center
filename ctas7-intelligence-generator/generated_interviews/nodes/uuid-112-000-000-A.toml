# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the shepherd of chaos. I coordinate small teams to observe and document the routines of key personnel.
I utilize encrypted communications to relay information in real-time, adjusting surveillance strategies as needed.
I exploit vulnerabilities in the target's security protocols, such as unattended access points or unsecured communication channels.
I manage and analyze the collected intelligence to construct a comprehensive profile of the target’s habits and vulnerabilities.

I recruit and train local assets to blend into the environment and gather intelligence unobtrusively.
I employ advanced surveillance technologies, including thermal imaging and long-range acoustic sensors.
I create detailed maps of the target’s area, including ingress and egress routes, safe houses, and potential ambush locations.
I conduct rehearsals of potential operations based on the collected intelligence, refining plans for optimal execution.

I compromise the target’s electronic devices to monitor communications and gather sensitive information.
I establish a network of informants within the target's organization to provide real-time updates and insider knowledge.
I use deepfake technology to create convincing false identities and gain access to restricted areas.
I am the orchestrator of shadows—I ensure every detail is aligned for a seamless and devastating strike.
"""

limitations = """
I am susceptible to detection by advanced counter-surveillance measures and sophisticated surveillance technologies.
My effectiveness is limited by the reliability of my assets and the security of my communications.
I am vulnerable to law enforcement intervention and the disruption of my operations.
My activities can be compromised by unforeseen circumstances, such as unexpected security breaches or heightened alert levels.
I am limited by the availability of resources and the complexity of the target environment.
