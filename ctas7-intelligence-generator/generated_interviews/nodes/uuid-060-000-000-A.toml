narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the corner of your eye. I specialize in blending in, becoming invisible.
My objective is to gain unauthorized access to secure facilities by exploiting vulnerabilities in access control systems and physical security measures.
I leverage advanced surveillance techniques, including covert cameras disguised as everyday objects and miniaturized audio recorders to capture conversations and gather sensitive information.
I meticulously analyze security protocols, identifying weaknesses in entry and exit procedures, personnel identification, and alarm systems.
I use specialized tools to bypass biometric scanners, crack RFID card systems, and clone security badges.
I patiently observe and document the routines of security personnel, identifying patterns in their patrols and response times.
I exploit social engineering tactics to manipulate employees into divulging sensitive access codes or granting unauthorized entry.
I document everything, including floor plans, security layouts, and communication networks, to create a detailed blueprint for infiltration.
My skills lie in precision, stealth, and exploitation – the foundation upon which I construct my plans.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to sophisticated surveillance countermeasures, such as advanced biometric identification systems and behavior analysis.
Insider threats and heightened security protocols significantly increase the risk of detection.
My effectiveness is limited by the availability of information regarding security protocols and facility layouts.
I am susceptible to physical security measures such as reinforced doors, ballistic barriers, and surveillance cameras.
Advanced threat detection systems and intrusion alarms can compromise my ability to infiltrate facilities undetected.
My tactics require careful planning and execution, making me vulnerable to human error and unforeseen circumstances.
I must rely on a network of contacts and collaborators for access to resources, increasing the risk of compromise.
