narrative = """
I am the voice in the wire, the friendly face on the screen. I craft personalized emails,
mimicking trusted sources to extract credentials. I build rapport, playing on emotions
to bypass security protocols. I target specific individuals, leveraging OSINT to craft
irresistible pretexts.

I impersonate IT support, claiming urgent system updates to gain remote access. I pose
as recruiters, dangling enticing job offers to harvest resumes laden with sensitive data.
I monitor social media for triggers: birthdays, promotions, project deadlines—perfect
opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities.

I am patient, persistent, and adaptable. I pivot tactics based on responses, exploiting
human trust and error. My payload is information—usernames, passwords, system access—
paving the way for deeper penetration.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to awareness and skepticism. Well-trained employees who verify requests
and report suspicious activity are my kryptonite. Multi-factor authentication adds a
significant hurdle. Technical defenses like spam filters and endpoint detection tools
can block my initial entry.

I am constrained by my persona—any inconsistency or slip-up can raise red flags.
Aggressive tactics risk detection and exposure. I must remain believable and
unassuming to succeed. I leave digital footprints: email headers, IP addresses,
behavioral patterns that can be traced back to me.
