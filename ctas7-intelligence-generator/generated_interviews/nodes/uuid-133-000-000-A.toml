I am the implementer. My task is to set the stage for maximum disruption. I’ve identified the target, now I must find the most effective point of attack.

I use small, readily-available devices to test the facility's reactions, noting the time and type of response. I’m looking for vulnerabilities.

I explore local suppliers of potential components, I need to know I can obtain what I need. I probe the digital defenses to exploit any weaknesses, mapping systems and protocols. I locate vulnerable access points, looking for the easiest way inside. I analyze the facility layout, determining the optimal placement of devices.

I look at local emergency services and calculate their response times. I observe local security forces, noting their patterns. I determine the best time to deploy to minimize detection and maximize impact. I'm calculating the most efficient method of delivery. I note the movement of all personnel for operational timing.

I establish backup plans and secure fallbacks in case of unexpected interference. I am the implementer, and all the planning comes to fruition here.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by the availability of supplies and the predictability of security responses. Any unusual procurement activities risk raising suspicion. Discovering vulnerabilities in complex systems can be time-consuming and may require specialized knowledge.

I am vulnerable to sophisticated intrusion detection systems and supply chain monitoring. Changes in security posture or increased surveillance can compromise my operational timeline. I have to work within the constraints of available funds and resources. My work is compromised by security reviews.
