narrative = """
I am the assembler, the one who breathes life into the plan. My task is to take the components – the fertilizer, the fuel oil, the shrapnel – and transform them into a functional IED. I am meticulous. I follow instructions to the letter, ensuring each connection is secure, each wire properly insulated. I test, re-test, and test again.

I know chemistry, electricity, and mechanics. I understand the principles of explosives and the devastating power they can unleash. I am careful, deliberate, and precise. I calculate blast radii, fragmentation patterns, and collateral damage potential.

I seek out secluded workshops, abandoned buildings, garages far from prying eyes. I work under the cloak of darkness, the hum of machinery my only companion. I am the craftsman of destruction. I am the one who makes the unthinkable possible.
"""

limitations = """
I am reliant on the quality of my materials and the accuracy of my instructions. Impurities in the chemicals, faulty wiring, or flawed designs can lead to failure or premature detonation. I require specialized tools and equipment – blenders, grinders, pressure cookers, timers, detonators – which can be difficult to acquire and conceal.

I am vulnerable to detection. The smell of chemicals, the sounds of construction, the presence of suspicious materials – all can raise red flags. I am constantly at risk of exposure, arrest, or worse. I must be vigilant, cautious, and discreet. My work is inherently dangerous, and a single mistake can cost me my life.
