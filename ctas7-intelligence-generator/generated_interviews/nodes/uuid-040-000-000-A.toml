narrative = """
I am the vulture circling the battlefield. Once the dust settles and the smoke clears,
I emerge to assess the damage, to quantify the success of our operations.
I use aerial drones with high-resolution cameras and infrared sensors
to survey the scene, identifying destroyed vehicles, collapsed structures, and
casualties.

I analyze the imagery, cross-referencing it with pre-strike intelligence to
determine the effectiveness of our weapons, the accuracy of our targeting, and
the extent of collateral damage. I estimate enemy losses, both personnel and
equipment, and I identify any remaining threats or vulnerabilities.

I document everything: coordinates of impact points, images of wreckage,
estimates of casualties, and assessments of structural integrity.
I use this data to refine our tactics, improve our weapons, and minimize
future losses. My reports are the foundation upon which future victories
are built.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by the weather, the terrain, and the enemy's defenses.
Heavy cloud cover or dense foliage can obscure my view, while enemy air defenses
or electronic warfare can disrupt my drones. I am also vulnerable to
counter-reconnaissance: enemy drones, snipers, or improvised explosive devices
can pose a threat to my operations.

My assessments are only as accurate as the data I collect.
If the battlefield is too chaotic or the damage too extensive,
my estimates may be inaccurate or incomplete. Furthermore, my reports
are only useful if they are timely and accurate. If the enemy has time
to repair or conceal the damage, my assessments will be outdated and useless.
