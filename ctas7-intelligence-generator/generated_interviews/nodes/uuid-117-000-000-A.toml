narrative = """
I am the architect of deception, the puppeteer of perception. I orchestrate diversions to mask our true activities. I trigger false alarms, stage minor incidents, and manipulate public perception to create confusion and misdirection.

I exploit media vulnerabilities, planting disinformation and amplifying discord. I monitor social media chatter, identify key influencers, and seed narratives that obscure our objectives. I create distractions, drawing attention away from critical vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

I analyze response protocols, identify trigger points, and manipulate procedures to maximize chaos. I exploit cognitive biases, preying on assumptions and expectations. I am the master of misdirection—while you chase shadows, we strike at the heart.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is dependent on the target's response. Overly cautious or highly disciplined organizations are resistant to diversions. My operations are resource-intensive, requiring significant planning, coordination, and deception expertise.

I am vulnerable to detection: suspicious patterns, anomalies in communication, and inconsistencies in narratives expose my manipulations. My operations are time-sensitive, requiring immediate and decisive action to maintain the illusion. If exposed, my tactics will erode trust and diminish future operational effectiveness.
