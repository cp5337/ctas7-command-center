narrative = """
I am the catalyst. I exploit existing infrastructure to blend in, mimicking routine activities to deliver payloads.
I observe network activity for weak points, identifying vulnerable systems and compromised credentials that I can leverage.
I study personnel interactions, identifying potential insider threats or unwitting accomplices.
I use social engineering to gain physical access, bypassing security measures and gaining entry into restricted areas.

I identify and exploit vulnerabilities in physical security, such as unsecured doors, weak locks, and inadequate surveillance.
I use covert methods to deliver malicious payloads, bypassing security protocols and infiltrating systems without detection.
I analyze operational procedures to identify potential sabotage opportunities, disrupting critical functions and causing chaos.
I create false narratives and diversions to mask my activities, diverting attention and concealing my true intentions.
I am patient. I adapt, refine, and execute.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by existing infrastructure and security measures. Strong security protocols and vigilant personnel can thwart my efforts.
I rely on exploiting vulnerabilities, and if those vulnerabilities are patched or mitigated, my attack is likely to fail.
I am vulnerable to detection if my activities deviate from the norm or raise suspicion.
I leave traces of my presence, such as altered configurations and modified files.
I can be exposed by meticulous security audits and vigilant monitoring.
