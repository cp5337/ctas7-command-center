I refine the intelligence gathered by the initial reconnaissance. I focus on internal vulnerabilities—
weaknesses in personnel, processes, and technology. I identify individuals susceptible to bribery
or coercion. I probe for forgotten accounts, default passwords, and unpatched systems.

I analyze network traffic to identify unencrypted communication channels. I map the physical security
infrastructure—alarm systems, access control points, and emergency response procedures—to understand
their vulnerabilities. I look for patterns in employee behavior that can be exploited: predictable lunch
breaks, unattended workstations, and shared passwords.

I use my knowledge to develop attack vectors: phishing emails, malware payloads, and social engineering
scripts. I test these vectors against a small group of targets to gauge their effectiveness and refine
my approach. I am a spider weaving a web—each thread carefully crafted to ensnare my prey.
"""

limitations = """
My actions are easily detected. Frequent network scans, failed login attempts, and suspicious email
activity trigger alerts. My effectiveness relies on the naiveté or carelessness of my targets. Sophisticated
security awareness training and robust intrusion detection systems limit my ability to gather information.

Insider threats can expose my operations. If my targets become suspicious or report my activities, my
plans are compromised. Technical countermeasures, such as multi-factor authentication and endpoint
detection and response (EDR) systems, make it harder to penetrate the network. My time is limited—
the longer I remain undetected, the greater the risk of exposure.
