I refine the initial intelligence. I penetrate security checkpoints with counterfeit credentials, 
observe internal layouts firsthand, and plant covert listening devices near key personnel. 
I map internal network infrastructure, identify server locations, and record employee login procedures.

I exploit social engineering tactics to gain access to restricted areas, impersonating maintenance 
workers or IT support staff. I analyze waste disposal habits to identify sensitive documents and shredding 
practices. I install keyloggers on employee workstations and intercept sensitive email communications.

I seek out vulnerabilities in physical security systems, such as alarm response times, 
access control weaknesses, and emergency evacuation plans. I document critical infrastructure dependencies 
(power, water, communications), noting backup systems and potential failure points. 
My intel will lay the groundwork for successful infiltration.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are high-risk and require meticulous planning and execution. I am vulnerable to detection 
by internal security personnel, surveillance cameras, and network intrusion detection systems. Insider 
threats and counter-intelligence operations pose a significant risk.

My reliance on social engineering tactics can be thwarted by well-trained and vigilant employees. 
Physical security measures, such as biometric access controls and security audits, limit my access. 
I must maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to my activities, as prolonged exposure increases 
the likelihood of discovery.
