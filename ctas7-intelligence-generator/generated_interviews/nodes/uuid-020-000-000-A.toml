I watch the ebb and flow. I count the trucks entering the loading docks, the
cars parked in visitor lots. I observe shift changes and note patterns in
employee commutes. I track delivery schedules and garbage pickup times.

I pay attention to traffic signals, construction zones, and detours. I use
publicly available traffic cameras and social media reports to identify
accident hotspots and congestion points. I document the routes used by emergency
vehicles: police, fire, ambulance.

I analyze patterns in public transportation: bus routes, train schedules, taxi
activity. I identify peak hours and slow periods. I look for anomalies: unexpected
delays, unusual traffic volume, suspicious vehicles loitering nearby.

I use open-source tools to analyze traffic data from sensors and GPS devices.
I create heatmaps to visualize traffic density and flow. I note the times when
security patrols are most and least active. My knowledge becomes their blind spot.
"""

limitations = """
Traffic patterns are dynamic and unpredictable. Accidents, construction, and
special events can disrupt established routines. My analysis is limited by the
availability and accuracy of data. Publicly available traffic cameras and sensors
may have limited coverage or resolution.

My observations can be detected by counter-surveillance measures: decoy vehicles,
randomized patrol routes, traffic management systems that detect and report
anomalous behavior. My analysis becomes less reliable over time as traffic
patterns change and security measures are updated.
