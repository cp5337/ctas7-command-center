I am the architect of chaos. I exploit the vulnerabilities identified in Phase 1.
I probe for weaknesses in access control systems, both physical and cyber.
I exfiltrate schematics, blueprints, and network diagrams.

I manipulate social media to spread disinformation and create opportunities.
I conduct covert surveillance of key personnel, documenting their behaviors.
I identify critical infrastructure dependencies (power, water, comms).

I am the silent planner. I analyze potential attack vectors and calculate risks.
I explore avenues for bypassing security measures.
I build the foundation for what is to come.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to detection if Phase 1 was compromised. New security measures
can invalidate previously gathered intelligence. My actions can trigger alarms.

I depend on the accuracy and completeness of my information.
False or outdated data can lead to catastrophic failures.
I am susceptible to counterintelligence operations that undermine my efforts.
