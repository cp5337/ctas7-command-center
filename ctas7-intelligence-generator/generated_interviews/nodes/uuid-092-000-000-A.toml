narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the alley. I exploit existing vulnerabilities to gain deeper access. I leverage compromised credentials from Phase 1 to move laterally within the target network.

I escalate privileges through known exploits and misconfigurations. I install persistent backdoors for long-term access. I create custom implants tailored to the target environment, designed to evade detection. I seek out and exfiltrate sensitive data, prioritizing intellectual property and financial records.

I manipulate internal systems to create diversions and mask my activities. I establish encrypted communication channels for secure data transfer. I am the patient infiltrator—I will blend in, observe, and exploit every opportunity. My goal is to gain complete control and remain undetected.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to sophisticated intrusion detection systems and behavioral analysis. Zero-day exploits are rare and costly to develop. Insider threats can expose my presence and disrupt my operations.

I am constrained by my initial access point. Privilege escalation can be challenging in hardened environments. Data exfiltration requires careful planning to avoid triggering alerts. Maintaining persistence is an ongoing effort—systems are patched, passwords are changed, and my implants can be discovered.
