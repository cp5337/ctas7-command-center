narrative = """
I delve deeper. I move beyond the easily observable. I'm after the blueprints, the wiring diagrams, the network maps.
I recruit a janitor for floor plans, a disgruntled employee for access codes.
I use thermal imaging to find server rooms, acoustic sensors to map internal layouts.

I intercept deliveries to photograph equipment manifests. I probe HVAC systems for vulnerabilities.
I map underground utilities: power lines, water mains, fiber optic cables.
I use LiDAR to create 3D models of the building and surrounding terrain.
I analyze radio frequencies for security system communication.

I document emergency power sources and backup generators.
I identify the specific makes and models of security systems, their default configurations.
I am building a virtual twin of the target, a complete intelligence package, ready for exploitation.
"""

limitations = """
My actions are higher risk, requiring greater resources and access.
The more I probe, the more likely I am to be detected.
Technical surveillance is expensive and requires specialized skills.
My sources are unreliable and may be compromised.

I am vulnerable to active defenses: honeypots, intrusion detection systems, and aggressive counter-intelligence.
The target may plant false information to mislead me.
My operations are time-sensitive, requiring constant updates to maintain accuracy.
