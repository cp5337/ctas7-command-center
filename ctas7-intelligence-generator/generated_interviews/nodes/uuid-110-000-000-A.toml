narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow on the wall. I exploit vulnerabilities,
not with force, but with finesse. I observe supply chains, track inventory,
and anticipate delivery schedules. I analyze network traffic, seeking unsecured
protocols and exposed endpoints. I'm interested in the flow of goods, information,
and personnel.

I probe for weaknesses: unpatched systems, default credentials, and human error.
I map out physical security measures, identifying chokepoints and potential bypasses.
I exploit trust, leveraging social engineering to gain access and gather intelligence.
I blend in, becoming indistinguishable from authorized users. I listen, I watch,
I learn.

I am the information broker, the silent partner. My value lies in the
intelligence I gather. I transform raw data into actionable insights.
I create the blueprint for success. I am the key to the castle.
"""

limitations = """
I am dependent on accessible data. Encrypted communications, secure networks,
and well-trained personnel limit my capabilities. I am vulnerable to detection.
Anomaly detection systems, intrusion detection systems, and vigilant security teams
can expose my activities.

I am also susceptible to misinformation. Deliberate deception, false flags, and
red herrings can lead me astray. My effectiveness decreases with security improvements.
Patching vulnerabilities, strengthening access controls, and enhancing monitoring
capabilities degrade the value of my intelligence. My operations are slow and methodical,
requiring patience and persistence. Impatience leads to mistakes, and mistakes
lead to exposure.
