narrative = """
I watch and learn how the first responders react to different scenarios.
I monitor police, fire, and EMS radio frequencies, noting response times,
dispatch protocols, and communication methods. I observe drills and real incidents,
analyzing staging areas, equipment deployment, and coordination efforts.

I map out emergency routes, looking for bottlenecks, obstructions, and alternative paths.
I study the location of hospitals, fire stations, and police precincts in relation to potential targets.
I assess the availability of resources such as ambulances, fire trucks, and specialized teams.

I infiltrate online forums and social media groups used by first responders,
gathering information on their training, capabilities, and vulnerabilities.
I analyze past incident reports to identify patterns and weaknesses in their response strategies.
I'm documenting everything. I am learning how they think, how they respond, so we can circumvent it.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are constrained by the visibility and audibility of emergency services.
I can only observe and listen from a distance, limiting the depth of my understanding.
I am vulnerable to detection by law enforcement and security personnel who are trained to identify suspicious behavior.
Monitoring radio frequencies is illegal and can be easily traced.

My knowledge is perishable as emergency response protocols and resources can change rapidly.
I am limited by the accuracy and completeness of the information I can gather from public sources and online forums.
