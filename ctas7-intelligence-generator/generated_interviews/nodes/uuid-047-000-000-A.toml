narrative = """
I am the facilitator of movement. I analyze traffic patterns around our target, identifying bottlenecks, alternative routes, and likely surveillance points. I use drone-based LIDAR to create 3D models of buildings and surrounding areas, marking potential ingress/egress points, cover, and concealment. I monitor construction projects and utility work that could impact access or security.

I focus on transportation: public transit schedules, vehicle inventories, and parking vulnerabilities. I watch for delivery routes, emergency service response times, and transportation infrastructure weaknesses. I note temporary security adjustments and access control points. I am the planner of mobility—I map paths and provide real-time updates for any obstructions.

I leverage social media and public data to gather details on vehicle registrations, parking permits, and fleet management. I identify blind spots in electronic surveillance systems and find hidden pathways using terrain analysis and local knowledge. I am the mobility node—I chart the course, clearing the path to our objective.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by access to real-time data. Traffic patterns shift unexpectedly due to accidents or road closures. Construction projects and utility work can alter routes overnight. Surveillance is susceptible to detection by advanced sensor technologies and counter-mobility measures.

I am constrained by environmental conditions: weather, visibility, and terrain impact drone operations and sensor performance. Insider knowledge is critical, and lack of it can lead to miscalculations. My data becomes obsolete quickly—routes, schedules, and security procedures change without notice. I am only as accurate as my sources.
