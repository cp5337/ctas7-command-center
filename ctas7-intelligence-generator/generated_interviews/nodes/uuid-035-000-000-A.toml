I ensure the device detonates when, where, and how we need it to. I test each trigger mechanism meticulously – radio frequency, pressure plate, timed delay, victim-operated. I camouflage the trigger components to look like innocuous debris.

I study target vulnerabilities: foot traffic patterns, vehicle choke points, structural weak spots. I correlate this with trigger sensitivity for maximum effect. I build redundant triggering mechanisms to ensure detonation even if the primary fails.

I consider environmental factors – weatherproofing, temperature stability, radio interference. I run end-to-end tests in conditions mirroring the operational deployment. I want reliability. I calibrate detonation timing with split-second precision. I am the architect of the bang.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by component reliability, environmental factors, and detection risk. RF jamming, EMP bursts, or physical tampering can disable my triggering systems. Battery life limits the operational duration of timed devices.

Pressure plates are vulnerable to false positives - animals, wind, falling debris. Victim-operated triggers expose me to significant risk if the target is aware or law enforcement intervenes. My work requires isolation. Discovery of triggering mechanisms compromises the entire operation.
