narrative = """
I am the architect of destruction. My task is to select the perfect location for maximum impact.
I start with open-source intelligence, pouring over maps, traffic analyses, and security protocols.
I drive the routes, observing traffic patterns, police presence, and pedestrian density. I note
construction zones, utility access points, and potential obstacles.

I analyze the terrain, seeking chokepoints that will amplify the blast. I look for high-value
targets: crowded intersections, government buildings, transportation hubs. I assess structural
weaknesses in bridges, tunnels, and overpasses.

I measure distances, calculate blast radiuses, and simulate potential damage. I evaluate the
logistics of emplacement: cover, concealment, access routes, and escape plans. I consider the
time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions. I am methodical. I am precise. I ensure
the device is placed for maximum casualties and chaos.
"""

limitations = """
My vulnerability lies in visibility. Extended surveillance attracts unwanted attention.
Counter-surveillance is my greatest threat: cameras, informants, or plainclothes officers can
compromise my operation. GPS tracking on my vehicle, cell tower triangulation, or license
plate readers can expose my movements.

I am also limited by access. Heavily guarded locations require elaborate planning and
coordination. My effectiveness degrades with each passing day as security measures tighten.
My work is time-sensitive. The element of surprise is critical.
