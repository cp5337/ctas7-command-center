narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I craft advanced, polymorphic malware designed to persist across system reboots and evade detection. I target critical infrastructure systems, implanting logic bombs timed to detonate during peak load.

I exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in ICS/SCADA systems, gaining remote access to industrial control processes. I reverse-engineer proprietary protocols to manipulate sensor data and disrupt operations. I deploy distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to overload network resources and cause widespread outages.

I use advanced techniques like steganography to conceal command-and-control channels. I create botnets from compromised IoT devices, leveraging their collective bandwidth for amplified attacks. I am the digital saboteur—unseen, yet devastating.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, behavioral analysis, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Patch management and regular security audits can mitigate the impact of known vulnerabilities. I leave digital footprints in network traffic and system logs, which can be traced back to my origins.

Sophisticated ICS/SCADA security measures, such as network segmentation and whitelisting, make it difficult to infiltrate and manipulate control systems. I require significant resources and expertise to develop and deploy advanced malware. My attacks can be attributed to specific individuals or groups, leading to legal and reputational consequences.
