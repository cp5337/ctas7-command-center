narrative = """
I am the assembler, the craftsman of chaos. I transform raw materials into instruments of destruction.
I source components from the shadows, using untraceable channels. I manipulate schematics, improvising
solutions with readily available materials. I test my creations in secluded locations, ensuring they
perform as intended.

I use lathes and mills to shape metal, 3D printers to fabricate custom parts. I experiment with chemical
compounds, seeking the most potent explosives. I study electronics, wiring circuits to control detonation.
I am meticulous, precise. Each device is a testament to my skill, a symphony of destruction waiting to be unleashed.

I conceal my workshops, moving frequently to avoid detection. I communicate through encrypted channels,
protecting my identity. I am patient, methodical. The final product must be flawless, a weapon capable
of delivering maximum impact.
"""

limitations = """
Sourcing components is a constant challenge. Suspicious orders attract attention, and quality materials
are difficult to obtain. My expertise is limited. I am not a trained engineer or chemist, so I rely on
trial and error.

Security is paramount. My workshops are vulnerable to raids, and my communications can be intercepted.
I am constrained by resources. Advanced tools and materials are expensive and difficult to acquire. The
risk of accidental detonation is ever-present. My work is inherently dangerous, and a single mistake
could cost me everything.
