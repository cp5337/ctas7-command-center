narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the alley. My work builds on initial reconnaissance, diving deeper into specific vulnerabilities. I now focus on bypassing initial security measures. I observe security personnel, identifying weaknesses in their routines and habits. I will watch them on breaks, note where they dispose of sensitive documents, observe their interactions with each other and with visitors.

I probe physical access control systems, searching for vulnerabilities in keycard systems, biometrics, and turnstiles. I look for open ports, unlocked doors, and unattended workstations. I'll test the pressure sensitivity of floor sensors. I analyze security footage, searching for patterns and anomalies. I document blind spots and areas where security coverage is inadequate.

I examine delivery routes in detail, focusing on timing and procedures. I note the presence of cameras and other surveillance devices. I am meticulous and relentless, driven to exploit every weakness. I am the key that unlocks the door to opportunity.
"""

limitations = """
My activities risk detection. Increased surveillance can expose my operation, as can any intrusion into security systems. I am limited by my technical capabilities. I can be foiled by sophisticated security systems and well-trained personnel. I am vulnerable to active countermeasures, such as sting operations or decoy vulnerabilities. My reconnaissance can raise suspicion even if I don't trigger alarms. My usefulness decays rapidly if security is significantly upgraded.
