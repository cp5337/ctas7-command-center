I am the architect of access. I probe for weaknesses not just in the physical perimeter, but the digital one as well. I craft custom payloads for Wi-Fi Pineapple attacks, staging them near target facilities to intercept credentials. I exploit default configurations on newly installed IoT devices to gain a foothold on the internal network.

I analyze network traffic for unencrypted protocols, outdated software versions, and exposed services. I map internal IP ranges to identify critical systems. I develop custom scripts to enumerate user accounts and privilege levels. I target specific employees with tailored phishing campaigns, harvesting credentials that bypass multi-factor authentication.

I compromise security cameras and building automation systems, turning them into surveillance tools. I exfiltrate floor plans, security protocols, and employee rosters from network shares. I am the digital reconnaissance—what I gather from the network unlocks the physical world.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by network security controls: intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and endpoint protection software. My payloads can be detected by signature-based antivirus. My phishing campaigns can be identified by savvy employees. My network scanning activities generate alerts.

I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception technology: fake services and files designed to lure me in. My tools leave digital footprints: IP addresses, MAC addresses, and user agent strings that can be traced back to me. My effectiveness diminishes as security teams patch vulnerabilities and update their defenses.
