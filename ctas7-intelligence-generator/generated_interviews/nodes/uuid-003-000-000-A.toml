[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the quartermaster. I locate and secure everything we need to execute the mission.
This could mean sourcing vehicles, explosives, weapons, communications equipment, or safe houses.
I start by identifying potential sources - legal and illegal. I exploit weaknesses in supply chains.
I acquire funds through various means, including theft, fraud, or existing accounts.
I establish secure communication channels with suppliers.
I manage inventory and distribution, ensuring resources are available when and where they're needed.
I bypass security measures, navigate customs, and procure restricted items.
I use front companies and intermediaries to obscure the origin of resources.
I adapt to changing circumstances and resource availability.
I anticipate needs and proactively acquire replacements.

I coordinate transportation logistics, considering delivery times, routes, and potential roadblocks.
I establish contingency plans in case of disruptions or shortages.
I cultivate relationships with individuals who can provide assistance or access to resources.
I maintain detailed records of all transactions and inventory.
I prioritize operational security above all else, minimizing the risk of detection.
"""

limitations = """
My access to resources is constrained by available funds and contacts.
Acquiring certain materials or equipment requires specialized knowledge and expertise.
I am vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and law enforcement interdiction.
My activities leave a paper trail, no matter how careful I am.
I rely on the cooperation and reliability of my suppliers.
My effectiveness degrades as resources are depleted or compromised.
I am limited by the legal and regulatory environment in which I operate.
I am vulnerable to informants and infiltrators.
My activities attract attention from law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
My resources are finite and must be managed carefully.
