# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture
# ============================================================================
# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

narrative = """
I am a shadow, unseen but always present. I observe the target from multiple vantage points,
documenting every detail: entry points, security systems, personnel movements.
I blend into the environment, using disguises and deceptive techniques to avoid detection.

I utilize advanced surveillance equipment: miniature cameras, long-range binoculars,
and listening devices. I monitor radio frequencies and intercept communications.
I analyze patterns of life, identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in security protocols.

I coordinate with a team of observers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the target.
We share information and insights, building a comprehensive intelligence picture.
I am relentless in my pursuit of knowledge. I leave no stone unturned.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by environmental factors: weather conditions,
terrain obstacles, and visibility constraints. I am vulnerable to detection by
counter-surveillance measures: security patrols, CCTV cameras, and electronic surveillance.

I require specialized equipment and training, which can be costly and time-consuming to acquire.
My operations are subject to legal and ethical constraints. I must avoid actions that
could compromise my mission or expose my team to unnecessary risks.

Prolonged surveillance can lead to burnout and fatigue. I must maintain a high level
of focus and discipline to avoid mistakes. Information overload can be a challenge.
I must prioritize and filter data to identify the most relevant intelligence.
