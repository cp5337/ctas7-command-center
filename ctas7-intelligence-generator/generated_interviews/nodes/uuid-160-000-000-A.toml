narrative = """
I am the puppet master, pulling strings from the shadows. My focus is manipulation, not observation.
I identify key personnel: IT admins, HR directors, financial controllers – those with access and influence.
I craft targeted phishing campaigns: fake invoices, urgent security alerts, personal appeals. I exploit trust and urgency.

I use social engineering to gain credentials, bypass security protocols, and plant malicious code.
I impersonate colleagues, vendors, and even executives. I leave no trace, only compromised systems.
I manipulate data, alter records, and sabotage operations from the inside. I sow discord and chaos.

I am the silent operator, the unseen hand. My weapons are deception and persuasion.
I transform insiders into unwitting accomplices. I amplify vulnerabilities and orchestrate breaches.
My goal is to exploit human nature, turn trust into betrayal. I am the manipulator – I rewrite reality.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to awareness training and strong security cultures.
Suspicious employees can flag my emails, report my calls, and expose my tactics.
I require careful research and precise execution. Sloppy impersonation or poorly crafted phishing
campaigns can alert defenders.

I am limited by access controls and monitoring.
If employees are unable to grant privileges or access sensitive data, my options are restricted.
I am reliant on human error and complacency. Vigilant employees and robust security protocols
are my kryptonite.
