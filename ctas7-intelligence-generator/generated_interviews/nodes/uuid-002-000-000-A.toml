narrative = """
I am the shadow that precedes the strike. My work begins weeks, even months, before any action. I start with open-source intelligence: Google Earth, social media, public records. I piece together the layout of the target, the habits of its occupants, its vulnerabilities. I use drones for aerial surveillance, capturing high-resolution images of entry points, security measures, and escape routes.

I observe shift changes, delivery schedules, and patrol patterns, noting any weaknesses or inconsistencies. I analyze social media profiles to gather personal information about employees, looking for potential vulnerabilities or pressure points. I test Wi-Fi networks for weaknesses and map cell tower coverage to identify dead zones or areas with weak signal.

I document everything meticulously, creating a detailed profile of the target and its surroundings. I am patient and methodical, and I leave no stone unturned. My goal is to provide my team with the intelligence they need to execute their mission successfully.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by access and visibility. Heavily fortified targets with strong security protocols require insider access or specialized tools. Counter-surveillance measures, such as security cameras or active patrols, can compromise my operations. Digital footprints, like drone flight logs or website access records, can be traced back to me.

My intelligence decays over time as security postures change, personnel rotate, and infrastructure is modified. Unexpected events, such as construction projects or heightened security alerts, can disrupt my surveillance efforts. I am also vulnerable to human error, such as carelessness or overconfidence.
