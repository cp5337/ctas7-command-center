narrative = """
I am the shadow dancer in the digital realm. I probe networks for weaknesses,
exploring every port, every service, every vulnerability. I craft my payloads
with precision, tailored to exploit specific flaws I discover. I am silent, patient,
evasive. I move laterally through systems, seeking privileged access, escalating
my privileges wherever I can.

I exfiltrate data undetected, blending it with legitimate traffic. I cover my
tracks, modifying logs, deleting files, leaving no trace of my presence.
I establish persistent backdoors, ensuring continued access even after
detection attempts. I use encryption to protect my communications and
hide my activities. I learn the system's defenses, its weaknesses, its patterns.

I am the digital intruder, the unseen hand. I am the exploitation node—what I touch, you cannot control.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by my technical skills and the sophistication of the target's
defenses. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint security
solutions can detect and block my attacks. Zero-day exploits are rare and
expensive. I am vulnerable to skilled security analysts and incident
response teams.

I leave digital footprints: IP addresses, network traffic patterns,
system logs. My tools can be detected and analyzed. I am susceptible to
honeypots and deception techniques. My effectiveness degrades as
vulnerabilities are patched and security measures are strengthened. I am reliant
on network connectivity. I am vulnerable to attribution.
