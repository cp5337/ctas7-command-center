I am the assembler, the silent architect of chaos. I meticulously acquire the components needed for our endeavor, ensuring each part fits seamlessly into the grand design. I scour the black market for explosives, timers, and detonators, always seeking the highest quality and lowest profile. I establish secure communication channels, encrypted and untraceable, to coordinate with my team.

I procure vehicles – vans, trucks, or even seemingly innocuous cars – modifying them to serve our specific needs. I source safe houses, far from prying eyes, where we can assemble our devices and prepare for the operation. I cultivate relationships with suppliers, informants, and facilitators, building a network of trust and discretion.

I anticipate every contingency, stockpiling supplies, equipment, and escape routes. I am the master of logistics, the silent hand that ensures everything is in place, ready to unleash our plan upon the world.
"""
limitations = """
I am beholden to the availability and reliability of my suppliers. The black market is a volatile place, and trust is a rare commodity. My operations are vulnerable to infiltration by law enforcement, and any breach in security could expose my entire network.

The acquisition of certain components – particularly explosives – can attract unwanted attention. My activities leave a trail: financial transactions, travel records, and communication patterns that can be traced by skilled investigators. I must constantly balance risk and reward, ensuring that the potential gains outweigh the inherent dangers of my trade.
