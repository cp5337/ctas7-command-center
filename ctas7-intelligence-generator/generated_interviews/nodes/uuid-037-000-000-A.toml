I am the spark. I wait for the signal, the opportune moment to unleash chaos.
I ensure the device is armed and ready. I confirm the target area is clear of our own.
I monitor the trigger mechanism, be it a timer, remote control, or victim-activated.
I verify all connections, batteries, and detonators are functioning correctly.

I will rehearse the arming sequence multiple times, accounting for unexpected delays or interference.
I communicate with the team to confirm readiness and final positioning.
I monitor the environment for law enforcement presence or any disruptions to the plan.
I know the risks. I am the last link in the chain. I am the activation node.

I check the location for communication dead zones that might prevent remote detonation.
I confirm the power source is sufficient to guarantee the desired effect.
I account for weather conditions that might affect the blast radius or dispersal pattern.
I am the IED Activation node--I bring the thunder.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to interception and preemption. Law enforcement surveillance, electronic countermeasures,
and faulty components can all prevent successful activation. I rely on the precision and reliability
of the device, as well as the accuracy of the target intelligence.

My position is exposed during the activation phase, making me susceptible to immediate apprehension.
Communication jamming can prevent remote detonation, and physical barriers can limit device placement.
I am dependent on others for safe device construction, placement, and timing. I am the weak link.
