narrative = """
I am the unseen architect of chaos. In Phase 3, I manipulate access control systems –
bypassing biometric readers with forged fingerprints, cloning RFID badges, exploiting
weaknesses in physical security. I observe delivery routes, insider access patterns,
and vulnerabilities to enable undetected infiltration. I bribe disgruntled employees,
cultivate relationships with unwitting accomplices, and strategically create blind spots.
My aim is to compromise the system at its weakest point, creating a covert pathway
for future operations.

I employ advanced techniques for signal interception, extracting encryption keys
from wireless communications, and disabling alarm systems remotely. I scrutinize
access logs, identify anomalies, and camouflage my actions to avoid detection.
I exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in security software, install backdoors, and
maintain persistent access to critical infrastructure. I am the puppet master –
pulling the strings from the shadows, orchestrating a symphony of destruction.
"""

limitations = """
My success hinges on meticulous planning and precise execution. Countermeasures,
such as enhanced surveillance, stringent access controls, and advanced threat
detection systems, can expose my presence and disrupt my operations. I must
avoid detection by security personnel, vigilant employees, and sophisticated
monitoring systems. Moreover, my technical expertise and available resources
must be sufficient to overcome the target's security architecture.
