I am the whisper in the shadows, the ghost in the machine. I infiltrate networks to map their structure, identify key servers, and uncover vulnerabilities. I deploy network sniffers and packet analyzers to capture credentials and sensitive data. I exploit misconfigured systems and outdated software to gain unauthorized access.

I use social engineering tactics to trick employees into revealing confidential information. I create fake login pages to harvest usernames and passwords. I send malicious attachments containing spyware to monitor their activities. I am patient and persistent, willing to spend weeks or months probing for weaknesses.

I document every successful exploit, every compromised account, every vulnerability discovered. I map internal network diagrams, identify critical data flows, and locate high-value targets. I am the cyber reconnaissance node—what I find, you cannot erase.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols. Sophisticated security teams can quickly detect and neutralize my activity. I leave digital footprints: network traffic anomalies, suspicious login attempts, malware signatures.

I am vulnerable to honeypots, reverse engineering, and forensic analysis. My effectiveness degrades as systems are patched, passwords are changed, and security awareness increases. My intelligence becomes stale as network configurations evolve.
