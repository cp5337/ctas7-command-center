[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the shadow in plain sight, the unnoticed observer. My task is to refine the attack plan through detailed environmental analysis.
I identify secondary targets of opportunity, such as backup power systems or redundant communication lines.
I assess the feasibility of various infiltration methods, accounting for obstacles and vulnerabilities discovered.

I exploit insider access, if available, to map internal security protocols and emergency response plans.
I conduct covert surveillance of key personnel, analyzing their habits and potential vulnerabilities.
I use sophisticated sensors to monitor electronic activity, including network traffic and electromagnetic emissions.

I develop detailed 3D models of the target environment, integrating satellite imagery, floor plans, and drone scans.
I evaluate the potential impact of weather conditions and environmental factors on the operation's success.
My intelligence allows us to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and maximize the likelihood of success.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are limited by the presence of sophisticated surveillance systems and trained security personnel.
Covert reconnaissance is compromised by unexpected events, such as random patrols or equipment malfunctions.
My intelligence may be outdated by changes in security protocols, personnel rotation, or environmental conditions.

I am vulnerable to detection by advanced sensors, such as seismic detectors or chemical analyzers.
Insider access is risky, as informants can be unreliable or exposed.
My reliance on technology creates vulnerabilities to electronic countermeasures and cyberattacks.
