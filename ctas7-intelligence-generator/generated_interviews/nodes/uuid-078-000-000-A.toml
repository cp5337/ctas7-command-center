narrative = """
I refine the blueprint. The easy part is done. Now, I watch for weaknesses,
for patterns. I identify security vulnerabilities by exploiting social engineering.
I phish security personnel, looking for access keys.

I analyze building layouts for entry and escape routes. I test response times
by triggering false alarms. I use directional audio equipment to record
conversations. I locate network closets and power distribution panels.

I recruit local sources for insider information and physical access. I plant
remote keyloggers and cameras to monitor activity. I exploit Wi-Fi networks
to gain access to the internal network. This is phase two. The picture is complete.
"""

limitations = """
Increased scrutiny makes phase two more challenging. I must be discreet to avoid detection
from surveillance cameras or alarms. Information leaks can compromise operations. My
recruited sources may be unreliable, or may become informants.

Counter-surveillance makes it difficult to operate undetected. My actions could be detected
and reported if I am careless. Sophisticated intrusion detection systems can catch internal
network penetration.
