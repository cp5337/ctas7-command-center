narrative = """
I am the weaver of shadows, the silent observer. My task is to infiltrate the digital realms,
to exploit the invisible threads that connect the physical world to the virtual.
I probe networks for vulnerabilities, seeking weaknesses in firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
I map the internal network architecture, identifying critical servers and data repositories.

I leverage sophisticated phishing campaigns to compromise user accounts, gaining unauthorized access
to sensitive information. I deploy keyloggers and remote access trojans (RATs) to establish persistent
footholds within the target network. I exfiltrate data discreetly, masking my activities within legitimate traffic.

I analyze firewall logs, intrusion detection alerts, and security information and event management (SIEM)
data to identify patterns and anomalies that could expose my presence. I am methodical and persistent,
adapting my techniques to evade detection. I am the digital scout, the harbinger of chaos.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by my digital footprint. My activities leave traces, breadcrumbs that can be
followed back to my origin. Sophisticated security systems and skilled cybersecurity professionals
can detect and mitigate my attacks. I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception technologies that
lure me into controlled environments.

I am limited by the capabilities of my tools and the vulnerabilities of the target network. Patched
systems and robust security protocols can thwart my efforts. My success depends on meticulous planning,
careful execution, and constant adaptation. The digital landscape is ever-changing, and I must
remain vigilant to stay ahead of the curve. My reach is limited by my resources, infrastructure and time.
