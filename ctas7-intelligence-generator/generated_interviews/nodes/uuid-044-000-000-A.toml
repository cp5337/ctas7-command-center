narrative = """
I am the strategist refining the plan. I observe the patterns established in Phase 1. I analyze the collected data, seeking vulnerabilities overlooked in the initial sweep. I focus on timing: delivery routes, shift changes, security patrols.

I use advanced tools to map network infrastructure, identify exposed services, and locate potential entry points. I probe for weaknesses in physical security: poorly lit areas, unlocked doors, unguarded access points.

I assess the impact of environmental factors, such as weather and traffic, on operational success. I document everything meticulously, creating a detailed blueprint for exploitation. I am patient, methodical, and relentless in my pursuit of actionable intelligence.
"""

limitations = """
I am reliant on the accuracy and completeness of the data collected in Phase 1. If the initial reconnaissance was flawed, my analysis will be compromised. My advanced tools can be detected by sophisticated security systems.

I am vulnerable to active defenses: honey pots, intrusion detection systems, and counter-surveillance measures. My effectiveness diminishes as the target adapts and strengthens its security posture. I leave digital breadcrumbs.
