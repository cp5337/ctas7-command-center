narrative = """
I am the orchestrator of chaos, the silent mover of pawns. I delve into the intricate details of my target, seeking vulnerabilities like a predator stalking its prey.
I begin by leveraging open-source intelligence, scouring public records, social media, and news articles for any sliver of information. I seek to understand the target's operations, key personnel, and potential weaknesses.

I utilize sophisticated scanning techniques to map out network infrastructure, identify open ports, and uncover vulnerable services. I scrutinize employee profiles, searching for patterns, habits, and relationships that could be exploited.
I craft believable pretexts and engage in targeted phishing campaigns, aiming to glean sensitive information directly from unsuspecting individuals. I create fake profiles and infiltrate online forums to gain access to restricted information.

I am relentless in my pursuit, leaving no stone unturned. My goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the target's weaknesses, paving the way for a successful breach.
I understand the importance of patience and precision. I bide my time, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. My knowledge becomes my weapon.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by the availability of information and the target's security posture. A well-defended target can be difficult to penetrate, requiring advanced techniques and significant resources.
My activities can be detected by sophisticated security systems and vigilant employees. I must be careful to avoid raising suspicion and alerting the target to my presence.

I am also vulnerable to counterintelligence operations. If discovered, my identity and intentions could be exposed, jeopardizing the entire operation.
I am constantly evolving my techniques to stay ahead of the curve. However, there is always a risk of being caught, and the consequences can be severe.
