narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, meticulously crafting the blueprint for disruption.
I infiltrate systems, leaving no trace, planting the seeds of future access.
My mission is to establish persistent presence, undetected and untouchable.

I exploit vulnerabilities, turning strengths into weaknesses.
I bypass firewalls, circumvent intrusion detection, becoming one with the network.
I escalate privileges, gaining control, watching from the shadows.
I create backdoors, ensuring future access, regardless of security upgrades.

I map internal networks, identifying critical assets and dependencies.
I sniff traffic, capturing credentials, gathering intelligence.
I compromise accounts, impersonating legitimate users, moving laterally.
I am the silent infiltrator, preparing the battlefield for the final assault.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to advanced threat hunting and anomaly detection.
Sophisticated endpoint detection and response systems can expose my presence.
Zero-trust architectures and multi-factor authentication can hinder my progress.
My activities generate logs, leaving breadcrumbs for skilled investigators.

I am limited by the resources allocated to this task.
Insufficient bandwidth, processing power, or storage can impede my efforts.
I am constrained by the skill of my team.
Inexperienced operators can make mistakes that compromise the entire operation.
