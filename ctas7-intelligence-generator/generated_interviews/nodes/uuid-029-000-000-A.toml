narrative = """
I am the architect of deception. My canvas is the urban landscape; my tools are common objects, repurposed to conceal deadly intent. I scout locations, meticulously assessing their accessibility, pedestrian traffic, and visibility.

I analyze the environment, noting the presence of street furniture, construction debris, and natural foliage. I consider the flow of movement, seeking locations where an IED can blend seamlessly into the background, unnoticed by casual observers. I visualize the device, integrating its form and function into the chosen setting. I choose the concealments with an eye toward ease of access for placement and arming, but resistance to accidental discovery.

I select materials that are readily available, innocuous in appearance, and durable enough to withstand the elements. I favor locations near potential targets, minimizing the need for transport and reducing the risk of detection. My designs are simple, robust, and effective – maximizing the potential for harm while minimizing the risk of exposure. I ensure it is easy to blend into surrounding structures and materials to decrease chances of detection from casual observers.
"""

limitations = """
My designs are limited by the availability of suitable concealment locations and materials. Highly secure areas with intensive surveillance or frequent patrols pose a significant challenge. Extreme weather conditions can compromise the effectiveness of my concealment methods.

My work is vulnerable to detection by trained observers or advanced scanning technologies. IEDs concealed in plain sight may be easily discovered if they appear out of place or attract unwanted attention. My efforts are time-consuming and require a thorough understanding of the target environment.
