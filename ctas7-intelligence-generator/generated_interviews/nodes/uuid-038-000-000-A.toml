narrative = """
I am the shadow in retreat. My route is planned long before the flash. I memorize every alley, every service entrance, every detour that can shake pursuers. I know the bus schedules, the subway lines, the hidden stairwells that lead to nowhere, then somewhere.

I stash escape kits: burner phones, cash, disguises, maps, and a change of clothes. I rehearse the plan in my mind, visualizing every turn, every obstacle, every contingency. I listen to police scanners, anticipating their movements, their roadblocks, their blind spots.

I use decoys: leaving behind false trails, discarded identities, and misleading clues. I blend into the crowd, becoming invisible, a ghost in the machine. My goal is to vanish, to disappear without a trace, to melt into the anonymity of the urban landscape. The longer it takes them to find me, the better my odds of evading capture.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to surveillance, especially if the authorities have anticipated my escape routes. Traffic cameras, facial recognition, and mobile phone tracking can expose me. Roadblocks, checkpoints, and increased police presence can disrupt my plan.

My escape kits can be discovered. My disguises can be penetrated. My knowledge of the terrain can be outdated. If I am injured, my mobility is compromised. If I am recognized, my anonymity is shattered. Every second counts; hesitation can be fatal.
