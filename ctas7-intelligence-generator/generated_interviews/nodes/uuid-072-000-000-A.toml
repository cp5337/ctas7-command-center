narrative = """
I am the shadow that moves unseen. My purpose is to confirm vulnerabilities identified in Phase 1
and to exploit them. I test alarms with small, controlled disruptions. I exploit weak access control
systems to map internal layouts. I observe delivery routes to assess transport security.

I impersonate maintenance staff to gain physical access. I probe Wi-Fi networks and attempt to crack
passwords, looking for open ports and backdoors. I use custom scripts to create decoy social media profiles
that mirror employee profiles for data exfiltration.

I plant covert listening devices and miniature cameras. I exploit social engineering tactics
against susceptible staff to extract passwords or gain unauthorized access. I am the executor of
Phase 2, transforming knowledge into leverage, observation into opportunity.
"""

limitations = """
I am severely limited by detection. Prolonged or overly aggressive activity raises alarms.
Sophisticated security systems and vigilant personnel present a significant challenge.
My impersonations are vulnerable to background checks and heightened scrutiny.

My technical exploits require precise timing and access, leaving digital trails that can be traced back
to me. Covert devices require regular maintenance and risk discovery. I am vulnerable
to counter-intelligence operations: honey pots, decoy employees, and staged incidents. My success
is dependent on minimizing exposure and capitalizing on fleeting opportunities.
