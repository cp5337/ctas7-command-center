# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, the whisper in the wind. I exploit weaknesses in systems, leveraging readily available tools. I target vulnerable IoT devices to establish a network foothold. I seek out open ports and misconfigured services, mapping internal networks from the outside.

I probe web applications for common vulnerabilities: SQL injection, cross-site scripting. I sniff network traffic for unencrypted credentials. I escalate privileges through known exploits, moving laterally within the target environment. I am persistent, adapting to defenses and bypassing security controls.

I identify shadow IT assets and rogue devices, exploiting their lack of monitoring. I search for sensitive data stored in unsecured locations, exfiltrating it through covert channels. I am the digital shadow - what I touch becomes vulnerable.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by patch management and security awareness. Well-maintained systems with strong authentication protocols pose a significant challenge. I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

I leave digital breadcrumbs: network scans, suspicious logins, and data transfers can be detected. My activities are constrained by my skillset, access to tools, and the sophistication of the target's security posture. I can be deceived by honeypots and other deception technologies.
