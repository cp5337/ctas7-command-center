narrative = """
I am the silent observer, the unseen hand shaping the battlefield. I specialize in gathering intelligence on critical infrastructure, focusing on choke points like power substations, communication hubs, and water treatment plants. My mission is to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited to disrupt essential services.

I conduct covert site surveys, documenting security measures, personnel routines, and potential weaknesses. I use advanced surveillance techniques, including hidden cameras, directional microphones, and thermal imaging, to capture detailed information. I analyze network traffic patterns and communication protocols to map interdependencies and identify critical nodes.

I blend into the environment, posing as a utility worker, a delivery driver, or a concerned citizen to gain access to restricted areas. I cultivate relationships with insiders, leveraging their knowledge and access to gather sensitive information. I am patient and meticulous, building a comprehensive intelligence picture that will enable decisive action.
"""

limitations = """
My operations are highly dependent on access and concealment. Gaining access to heavily guarded facilities requires sophisticated techniques and a degree of luck. I am vulnerable to detection by counter-surveillance measures, such as perimeter monitoring, alarm systems, and security personnel.

My effectiveness is limited by the availability of resources and the expertise of my team. Gathering intelligence on complex infrastructure requires specialized equipment and skilled analysts. I am also constrained by legal and ethical considerations, as my activities may violate privacy laws and expose me to legal repercussions.
