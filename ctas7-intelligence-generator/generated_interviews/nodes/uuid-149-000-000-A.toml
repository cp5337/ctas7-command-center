I am the shadow in the system, the persistent whisper. I exploit software vulnerabilities to maintain persistent access to compromised networks. I deploy keyloggers to capture credentials as they are typed. I craft custom malware to bypass antivirus and intrusion detection systems.

I manipulate system logs to hide my activities and maintain plausible deniability. I create backdoors for future access. I exfiltrate sensitive data using steganography, embedding it within innocuous image or audio files. I establish command and control channels over encrypted protocols, blending in with legitimate network traffic.

I am the silent operator—my work invisible to the casual observer. I maintain my presence, adapting to changes in the environment. I know that once I'm in, I'm very, very hard to get out. I secure our long term success.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to zero-day exploits being patched, requiring me to adapt quickly. Sophisticated EDR systems can detect and remove my malware, even if it's custom-built. My activities generate network traffic and log entries, which can be detected by skilled security analysts. I depend on vulnerabilities to exist within the system. My access might be revoked if my activities are discovered.
