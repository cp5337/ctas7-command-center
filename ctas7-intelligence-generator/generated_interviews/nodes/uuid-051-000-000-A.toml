I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the alley. My objective: locate, identify, and document individuals and assets of interest beyond initial reconnaissance. I move into the operational phase now. I establish physical surveillance positions, using rental vehicles and inconspicuous clothing to blend into the environment. I use high-resolution cameras and audio recording equipment to capture detailed information: license plates, faces, conversations, and habits.

I expand my scope to include surveillance of residences, workplaces, and frequent locations. I use directional microphones to intercept communications. I observe interactions between individuals, identifying relationships and hierarchies. I analyze patterns of life, identifying vulnerabilities and opportunities for exploitation. I establish multiple contingency plans: alternative surveillance positions, escape routes, and communication methods. I maintain meticulous logs, documenting every observation, every interaction, every piece of intelligence. I am patient and thorough, building a comprehensive picture of my targets.

I utilize sophisticated surveillance techniques: GPS tracking devices, concealed cameras, and remote monitoring systems. I exploit vulnerabilities in wireless networks to intercept communications. I monitor social media activity to gather additional intelligence. I coordinate with other operatives, sharing information and resources. I am persistent, relentless, and methodical. My goal is to provide actionable intelligence for follow-on operations.
"""

limitations = """
I am exposed to counter-surveillance and detection. My movements can be tracked, my communications intercepted, my activities observed. My effectiveness is limited by environmental factors: weather, visibility, terrain. My technology can be compromised, my equipment malfunction, my plans disrupted.

I am vulnerable to human error: misidentification, misinterpretation, carelessness. I am constrained by legal and ethical boundaries. I cannot operate with impunity. My actions must be justified and proportionate. I rely on the cooperation and expertise of others. I am only as strong as my weakest link. The longer I operate, the greater the risk of exposure and compromise. My intelligence is perishable, and my operations must be conducted efficiently and effectively.
