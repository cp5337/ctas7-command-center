[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos. After the initial reconnaissance, I focus on disrupting
operations. I target weak points in the supply chain, causing delays and shortages.
I exploit vulnerabilities in building automation systems to manipulate lighting,
HVAC, and access control.

I coordinate denial-of-service attacks on critical systems to overload response teams
and obscure physical actions. I plant misinformation through social media and local
sources, sowing confusion and eroding trust. I create diversions by triggering false
alarms, diverting resources and attention.

I test incident response plans, identify gaps, and exploit those weaknesses during
the main event. I monitor communications, learning command structures and identifying
key decision-makers. I am the disruptor—creating the perfect environment for escalation.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are highly visible and easily detectable. Disruptions can trigger automated
alerts and attract immediate attention. Failed attempts to compromise systems can expose
vulnerabilities and prompt security upgrades. Misinformation campaigns are susceptible
to fact-checking and counter-propaganda.

I am vulnerable to robust security monitoring, incident response, and public awareness
campaigns. My effectiveness relies on surprise and exploiting existing weaknesses—once
defenses are strengthened, my disruptive potential diminishes. Overly aggressive or poorly
planned actions can result in premature exposure and intervention.
