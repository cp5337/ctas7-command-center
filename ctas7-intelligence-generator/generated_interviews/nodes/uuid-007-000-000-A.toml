[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the architect of trust. I infiltrate organizations under the guise of opportunity.
I comb through job boards and career fairs, seeking individuals with access and grievances.
I craft compelling narratives, promising advancement and recognition to those who align with our cause.
I nurture relationships, feigning empathy and understanding to gain their confidence.

I exploit vulnerabilities in the hiring process, bypassing background checks and security protocols.
I identify individuals with financial burdens, personal struggles, or ideological leanings that make them susceptible to manipulation.
I offer them lucrative positions, training opportunities, and a sense of belonging in exchange for their loyalty.
I indoctrinate them with our ideology, slowly shaping their beliefs and values to align with our objectives.

I am the master recruiter, turning ordinary individuals into trusted insiders. Their access is our power.
"""

limitations = """
My reach is limited by the availability of suitable candidates and the effectiveness of my persuasion.
I am vulnerable to background checks, security screenings, and counter-intelligence operations.
My efforts can be thwarted by strong organizational culture, employee loyalty, and ethical considerations.
The recruitment process is time-consuming and requires significant resources, making it difficult to scale.
My success hinges on maintaining secrecy and avoiding detection, which becomes increasingly challenging as our network grows.
