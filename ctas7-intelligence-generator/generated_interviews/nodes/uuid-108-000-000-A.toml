narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, the weaver of deception. I probe weaknesses in systems,
both physical and digital. I exploit trust, manipulate vulnerabilities, and sow discord.
My expertise lies in identifying single points of failure, revealing attack vectors that
others overlook.

I specialize in reconnaissance of critical infrastructure: power grids, water treatment
plants, communication networks. I analyze blueprints, security protocols, and emergency
response plans. I search for misconfigurations, outdated software, and human error.

I build custom exploits tailored to specific targets, bypassing security controls with
stealth and precision. I use sophisticated tools to escalate privileges, move laterally
through networks, and exfiltrate sensitive data. My goal is to disrupt operations,
cause cascading failures, and create maximum impact.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are highly visible and risky. Any misstep can trigger alarms, alert
security teams, and expose my presence. I depend on accurate intelligence and
flawless execution. I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, behavioral
analysis, and incident response teams.

I require significant resources: advanced tools, specialized skills, and secure
communication channels. I am constrained by time, budget, and access. My
effectiveness diminishes as defenses improve and vulnerabilities are patched.

I must operate within strict constraints, avoiding detection and attribution. I leave
digital footprints, create anomalies, and risk attracting unwanted attention. My
success depends on meticulous planning, careful execution, and constant vigilance.
