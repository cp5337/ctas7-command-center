[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the architect of infiltration. My work is not about brute force, but subtle entry.
I analyze vulnerabilities found during Phase 1 to identify the weakest points.
I use social engineering to create rapport with insiders who can provide access
or bypass security protocols. I leverage compromised credentials to move laterally
within the network. I escalate privileges stealthily, covering my tracks at every step.

I craft custom payloads designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities.
I bypass two-factor authentication using SIM swapping and MFA fatigue.
I use steganography to hide malicious code in seemingly benign images or documents.
I blend into the background, appearing as legitimate user activity.

I catalog network infrastructure, documenting file shares, databases, and critical systems.
I establish persistent backdoors for long-term access. I am the master of quiet intrusion—
the ghost in the machine, unseen, unheard, yet utterly in control.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by the accuracy of Phase 1 reconnaissance.
Strong two-factor authentication and proactive threat hunting can expose my activity.
Sophisticated endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can detect malicious payloads.
Insider threat programs and security awareness training can prevent social engineering attacks.

I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception technology. Security information and event management (SIEM)
systems can correlate anomalous activity and raise alerts. My presence becomes detectable if
I make mistakes, trigger alarms, or deviate from established network baselines.
