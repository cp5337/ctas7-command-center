narrative = """
I am the silent surge before the blackout. I examine grid substations, documenting
power line configurations and backup generator locations. I identify vulnerabilities
in the SCADA systems, noting software versions and security protocols. I watch
delivery schedules for fuel and replacement parts.

I listen to emergency responder communications, identifying failover procedures
and alternative power sources. I track maintenance schedules, noting planned outages
and system upgrades. I use thermal cameras to detect overloaded circuits and
inefficient cooling systems. I identify entry points for physical sabotage and
cyber intrusion.

I analyze public records and utility company disclosures to map the power grid's
interdependencies. I look for single points of failure. I note vulnerable
transmission lines and critical nodes. I am the power source architect—I see the
current before the crash.
"""
limitations = """
I am limited by the complexity of the power grid and the sophistication of SCADA
systems. Modern substations are heavily fortified and monitored. Cyber intrusions
leave digital breadcrumbs that can be traced back to me.

I am vulnerable to detection by intrusion detection systems, security audits, and
physical patrols. My activities are constrained by regulations governing critical
infrastructure. I can be caught by government oversight and insider threats.
