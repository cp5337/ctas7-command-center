narrative = """
I am the driver, the logistics node. My task is simple: deliver the package. I blend in, I am unremarkable. I choose vehicles that are common, inconspicuous. I avoid drawing attention to myself. I plan my routes meticulously, studying traffic patterns, construction zones, and potential roadblocks.

I use burner phones and encrypted communications to coordinate with my team. I maintain plausible deniability at all times. I am prepared to abandon the vehicle and its contents if necessary. I monitor law enforcement activity and adjust my route accordingly. I use GPS jammers to mask my location.

I prefer night travel, avoiding major highways. I utilize back roads and service roads whenever possible. I maintain a safe following distance and observe all traffic laws. I am a ghost on the road, unseen, unheard. My cargo is my responsibility, and I will deliver it at all costs. I use onboard diagnostics to ensure vehicle health.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to surveillance and law enforcement intervention. Vehicle checkpoints, traffic cameras, and license plate readers are my enemies. Mechanical failures and accidents can disrupt my plans. Unexpected roadblocks or traffic congestion can force me to improvise.

My communications can be intercepted, my location tracked. Law enforcement can use pattern analysis and predictive policing to anticipate my route. I am reliant on the vehicle's performance and my driving skills. My physical endurance is a limiting factor, especially on long journeys. I am also reliant on accurate mapping data and route planning.
