narrative = """
I am the orchestrator, the coordinator. I weave together the strands of information gathered by others.
I integrate the reconnaissance data, the logistics reports, the target profiles. I build the attack plan,
step by step. I model the target environment, simulate the attack scenarios, and optimize for success.

I analyze vulnerabilities, prioritize objectives, and allocate resources. I coordinate the movement of
personnel and equipment. I establish communication channels and contingency plans. I create timelines,
checklists, and decision trees. I anticipate obstacles and develop workarounds. I prepare for every
eventuality.

I am the conductor of this symphony of destruction. My job is to ensure that every element is in place,
every player knows their role, and every action is synchronized. When the moment comes, my plan will
guide us to victory.
"""

limitations = """
I am dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the information I receive. Bad intelligence leads
to bad plans. Incomplete reconnaissance creates blind spots. Inaccurate logistics estimates lead to
delays and shortages. I am also vulnerable to information overload. Too much data can be as bad as
too little.

I am constrained by time and resources. Planning takes time, and resources are always limited.
I must make difficult trade-offs and prioritize the most critical elements of the plan. My plans are
also vulnerable to disruption. Unexpected events can throw the plan into chaos.
