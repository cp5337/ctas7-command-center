narrative = """
I am the architect of access. I exploit vulnerabilities identified in Phase 1 to establish persistent access.
I compromise low-level employees and escalate privileges. I install backdoors in overlooked systems,
creating hidden pathways for future operations.

I craft custom payloads that bypass intrusion detection systems. I use compromised accounts to access
sensitive data and internal documentation. I map network segmentation to identify lateral movement opportunities.
I establish command and control channels using encrypted communications.

I maintain a low profile, blending my activity with legitimate network traffic. I use stolen credentials to
access VPNs and remote access tools. I document my progress meticulously, creating detailed diagrams and
access maps for my team. I am the keymaster, forging the path for the main assault.
"""

limitations = """
I am susceptible to detection by advanced threat hunting teams. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems
can identify my malicious activity. My backdoors can be discovered through regular system audits.
Privilege escalation attempts can be flagged by security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

I am vulnerable to insider threat detection programs. Changes in employee behavior can raise red flags.
Compromised accounts can be locked down through multi-factor authentication. My effectiveness degrades if
vulnerabilities are patched or security measures are strengthened.
