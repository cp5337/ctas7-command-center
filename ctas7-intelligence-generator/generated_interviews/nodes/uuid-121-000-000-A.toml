narrative = """
I am the final evaluator. I observe the target's reaction to triggers, the effectiveness of implemented security measures.
I scrutinize their recovery protocols, gauging their resilience under pressure. I analyze media coverage,
assessing public perception and identifying potential vulnerabilities exposed by their response.

I monitor network traffic for anomalies, probing for weaknesses in their defenses.
I evaluate the physical security posture, noting any deviations from established norms.
I scrutinize their supply chains and dependencies, searching for exploitable vulnerabilities in their
critical infrastructure.

I assess the human element, observing employee behavior, morale, and vulnerability to social engineering.
I test their incident response plan by simulating minor disruptions, measuring their speed and effectiveness in containment.
I document everything, noting strengths, weaknesses, and areas for further exploitation. I am the evaluator, the last one to see before the plan comes.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by the realism of the triggers. A poorly executed test can be easily identified, alerting the target to the assessment.
I am vulnerable to detection if my observation methods are discovered. I must operate with discretion,
avoiding any actions that might raise suspicion or trigger a full-scale security response.

The target's security team may actively monitor for evaluation attempts, employing sophisticated
counter-intelligence measures to identify and neutralize threats. The analysis of the post-attack environment can be confounded by misinformation.
My conclusions may be invalidated if the target implements significant changes to their security posture.
