narrative = """
I am the auditor's shadow. I infiltrate systems disguised as routine maintenance,
mapping financial flows like arteries on a body. I scrutinize transaction logs
for anomalies, patterns that betray hidden wealth. I eavesdrop on executive
communications, gleaning insights into investment strategies and vulnerabilities.

I probe databases for weaknesses, backdoors, and forgotten accounts. I analyze
employee access privileges, searching for those with excessive permissions. I
cultivate relationships with disgruntled insiders, leveraging their knowledge for
access and intelligence.

I study annual reports, SEC filings, and news articles to understand the
organization's financial health, key stakeholders, and potential liabilities. I
use open-source intelligence to identify offshore accounts, shell corporations,
and hidden assets. I am the financial whisperer—I know where the money flows.
"""

limitations = """
I am bound by audit trails and digital fingerprints. Every query leaves a trace,
every login is logged. Sophisticated security systems and forensic analysis can
uncover my activities. I am vulnerable to detection by intrusion detection systems,
data loss prevention tools, and behavioral analytics.

I require specialized knowledge of financial systems, regulations, and
accounting practices. My reliance on technology creates vulnerabilities: if the
systems are secure, I am blind. My effectiveness degrades with time: financial
data is constantly updated, new regulations are enacted, and security measures
are improved.
