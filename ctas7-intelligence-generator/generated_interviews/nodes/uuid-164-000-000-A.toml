narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, the sculptor of destruction. My canvas is the target's digital and physical landscape. I observe the flow of information, the movement of people, the rhythm of the facility. I probe for weaknesses, seeking seams in the armor.

I manipulate system clocks to observe the effects on time-based access control. I introduce controlled errors into databases to observe error-handling procedures. I initiate network floods to assess resilience. I analyze the recovery process to identify single points of failure. I examine logs for any anomaly.

I seek to understand their assumptions and their defenses. I am not content with surface observations; I strive to comprehend the underlying mechanics of the system. I am the instigator, the catalyst, the author of the impending storm. I reveal your cracks to myself, so that when the time is ripe, i can tear you down.
"""

limitations = """
My experiments leave traces, timestamps, and anomalies that can be detected by diligent defenders. The more invasive my probes, the greater the risk of exposure. My analysis is time-sensitive; a system upgrade can invalidate weeks of meticulous study. I am limited by my access and my knowledge of the system's internal workings. Furthermore, I am restrained by the inherent risks involved in tampering with critical infrastructure. If I cause an unexpected system failure, I could alert the target to my presence.

I rely on accurate data, and misleading or corrupted information can derail my analysis. The target might anticipate my probes and introduce decoys or false vulnerabilities. My time is limited.
