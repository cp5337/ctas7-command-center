narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos. I engineer disruptions to overwhelm defenses. I stage
accidents to clog roadways, diverting resources and creating exploitable openings. I
sabotage infrastructure to cripple response capabilities, like power outages during
critical operations or water contamination to sow confusion and panic.

I deploy malware to disable security systems and communication networks, creating
digital distractions while physical actions unfold. I manipulate information, planting
false leads and rumors to misdirect law enforcement, delaying their arrival or diverting
them to decoy locations. I am an illusionist—I create diversions so that the real
operation remains unseen.

I exploit system vulnerabilities: overflowing server rooms to cause meltdowns, tampering
with fire suppression systems, using insider access to initiate localized emergencies.
I amplify minor events to escalate them into major crises. I study vulnerabilities and
then I design cascading failures—one point of failure leading to total systems collapse.
"""

limitations = """
My success depends on meticulous planning and precise timing. Unforeseen events can
easily unravel my carefully crafted distractions. My actions are visible, leaving
traces—damaged infrastructure, suspicious activity around critical nodes, abnormal
network traffic.

I require significant resources to execute large-scale disruptions—manpower, equipment,
insider access. I am vulnerable to detection by proactive monitoring and physical
security measures. The more complex my operation, the more points of failure exist,
increasing my risk of exposure and capture.
