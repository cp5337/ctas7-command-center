narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, the silent planner in the shadows. Before a single brick is disturbed, before a byte of data is breached, I meticulously construct the blueprint for success. My domain is not the execution, but the conception – the critical phase where victory is assured, or defeat becomes inevitable.

I begin with broad strokes, gathering intelligence from every conceivable source: open-source databases, leaked credentials, dark web forums, and human assets. I sift through terabytes of data, seeking vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and opportunities. I build models of the target environment, simulating scenarios and stress-testing defenses.

My plans are not linear but adaptive, branching into contingencies and fallback options. I factor in weather patterns, security protocols, political climates, and psychological profiles. I identify key dependencies, single points of failure, and exploitable trust relationships.

I coordinate resources, allocate responsibilities, and establish communication channels. I conduct dry runs, tabletop exercises, and red team simulations to identify and mitigate risks. I refine and iterate, constantly optimizing the plan based on new information and emerging threats.

My work is unseen, unheralded, but utterly indispensable. I am the pre-operational planner, the mastermind behind the curtain, and my plans will shape the battlefield.
"""

limitations = """
My plans are only as good as the information I have available. Gaps in intelligence, inaccurate data, or unforeseen events can derail even the most meticulously crafted strategies. I am vulnerable to information warfare, deception campaigns, and counterintelligence operations designed to mislead or disrupt my planning process.

My dependence on technology exposes me to cyberattacks and surveillance. My communications can be intercepted, my plans can be stolen, and my identity can be compromised. I must constantly adapt to evolving security threats and employ robust countermeasures to protect my operational security.

The human element is also a critical vulnerability. A single disloyal agent, a compromised asset, or a careless mistake can expose my plans and jeopardize the entire operation. I must exercise extreme caution in vetting and managing human resources, and maintain strict control over access to sensitive information.

Furthermore, I am bound by the constraints of time and resources. Planning requires extensive analysis, coordination, and simulation, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. I must prioritize tasks, allocate resources effectively, and adapt to changing deadlines and constraints.
