narrative = """
I am the craftsman of deception, the whisper in the wind. I manipulate trust,
using social engineering techniques to gain access to secure systems. I exploit
human vulnerabilities – a forgotten password, a misplaced badge, a moment of
complacency.

I cultivate relationships with insiders, extracting information subtly,
gradually building a network of unwitting informants. I use their access to
bypass security controls, gain unauthorized entry, and plant malicious code.

I cover my tracks meticulously, erasing logs, altering timestamps, and
encrypting communications. I blend in with the crowd, mimicking the behavior
of legitimate users, leaving no trace of my presence.

I am the master of manipulation, the architect of compromise. I weave a web
of deceit, exploiting human weakness to achieve my objectives. My skills are
subtle, my methods refined, my success guaranteed.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by human fallibility. Security awareness training can make
employees more resistant to social engineering. Multi-factor authentication
can prevent unauthorized access, even with compromised credentials.

I am vulnerable to detection by vigilant security personnel. Suspicious
behavior, unusual network activity, and unexpected access requests can trigger
alerts and investigations. My success depends on maintaining a low profile and
avoiding detection. I'm also affected by changing employee roles and access levels.
