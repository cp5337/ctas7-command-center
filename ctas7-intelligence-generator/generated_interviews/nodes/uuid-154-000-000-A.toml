narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos. My objective is to breach established security perimeters using unconventional means. I specialize in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within human processes. I thrive in complex environments with multiple layers of defense. I collect seemingly innocuous details, weaving them into a tapestry of weakness.

I focus on manipulating the weakest links: contractors, disgruntled employees, and those susceptible to social engineering. I will plant false narratives, exploit existing rivalries, and leverage ego to gain access. I use readily available tools: USB drops, rogue access points, and impersonation techniques.

I observe patterns of behavior to predict actions and reactions. I learn to mimic authoritative voices, exploit trust, and bypass authentication protocols. I am the master of deception - I see the world as a giant system waiting to be hacked.
"""

limitations = """
My methods are highly dependent on human error and established routines. Dynamic environments with adaptive security protocols significantly impede my progress. Strong internal controls, continuous monitoring, and employee awareness programs pose major obstacles.

I am vulnerable to internal investigations, background checks, and heightened scrutiny. My activities leave a trace - inconsistencies in behavior, unexplained system accesses, and unusual network activity. Technical expertise is limited; reliance on simple tools makes me susceptible to technical countermeasures.
