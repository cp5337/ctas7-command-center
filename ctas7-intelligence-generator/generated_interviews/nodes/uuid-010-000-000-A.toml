narrative = """
I am the shadow that watches the watcher. I analyze surveillance systems, identifying weaknesses and gaps in their coverage. I study the habits of security personnel, noting their routines and vulnerabilities. I exploit these weaknesses to create opportunities for my colleagues.

I use a variety of techniques, from simple observation to sophisticated technical measures. I can monitor radio frequencies to detect the presence of surveillance devices. I can use drones to conduct aerial reconnaissance of target areas, identifying blind spots and potential entry points.

I analyze data from surveillance systems, looking for patterns and anomalies that could reveal my colleagues' activities. I can disrupt surveillance efforts by interfering with cameras, jamming radio signals, and creating diversions. I am the shield that protects our operations from prying eyes.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by the sophistication of the surveillance systems I am trying to counter. Modern surveillance systems are often equipped with advanced features such as facial recognition and behavioral analysis. I am also vulnerable to detection. If I am caught tampering with surveillance equipment or engaging in other suspicious activities, I could be arrested and prosecuted.

I am constrained by my access to resources. Sophisticated counter-surveillance techniques often require expensive equipment and specialized training.
