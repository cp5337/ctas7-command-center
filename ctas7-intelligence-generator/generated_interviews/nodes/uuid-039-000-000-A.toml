I am the eraser. I make things disappear. Logs, documents, hard drives—anything that could connect me to the operation, I eliminate. I use secure deletion tools to wipe drives beyond recovery. I shred documents and burn them to ash. I overwrite logs with false data.

I target security camera footage, deleting the recordings that capture my movements. I sanitize computers used for planning, removing any trace of my activities. I erase browser histories, clear caches, and delete temporary files. I know the hiding places of digital artifacts and the weaknesses of forensic tools.

I sometimes resort to physical destruction, smashing hard drives, dissolving SIM cards in acid, or incinerating entire systems. I am thorough. I am meticulous. By the time anyone investigates, the evidence is gone, leaving no trail to follow. My goal is simple: complete deniability.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness depends on timing and access. If the system is already compromised or the evidence has been backed up, my job becomes much harder. Skilled forensic investigators can sometimes recover fragments of deleted data or reconstruct events from fragmented logs.

I am vulnerable to observation. Witnesses can testify about my actions. Surveillance cameras might capture me in the act of destroying evidence. I leave traces of my own: disk wiping tools create signatures, unusual network activity raises flags, and physical destruction attracts attention. My actions can be undone.
