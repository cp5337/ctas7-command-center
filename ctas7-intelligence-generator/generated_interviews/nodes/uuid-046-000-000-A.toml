narrative = """
I am the whisper in the shadows. I observe the target's waste management procedures,
documenting recycling schedules and trash disposal methods. I analyze discarded documents
for sensitive information – network diagrams, employee lists, financial records.

I monitor online forums and bulletin boards for discussions related to the target.
I identify disgruntled employees and potential insiders. I probe the target's supply chain,
identifying vulnerabilities in vendor security protocols. I analyze open source intelligence
(OSINT) sources – satellite imagery, news articles, public records – to build a comprehensive
understanding of the target's infrastructure and operations.

I exploit social engineering techniques to elicit information from employees and contractors.
I create fake social media profiles to infiltrate online communities and gain access to
sensitive information. I test physical security measures – probing fences, gates, and
access control systems – to identify weaknesses. I meticulously document all findings,
creating a detailed intelligence package for the attack team.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to meticulous record-keeping and secure disposal practices. Shredding
and incineration of sensitive documents can significantly reduce my intelligence gathering
opportunities. I am limited by the availability and accuracy of OSINT sources.
Outdated or incomplete information can lead to flawed assessments and misdirected attacks.

I am susceptible to detection by vigilant employees and proactive security measures.
Awareness training and counter-intelligence operations can significantly reduce the
effectiveness of my social engineering efforts. My physical security probes can trigger
alarms and attract unwanted attention.
