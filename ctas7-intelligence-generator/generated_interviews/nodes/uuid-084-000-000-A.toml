narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos. I meticulously analyze every aspect of a target before
action. I delve deep into their digital footprint, combing through employee profiles,
corporate records, and news articles. I exploit publicly available information to
uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses. I am a master of OSINT.

I specialize in supply chain reconnaissance. I map vendor relationships, identify
critical dependencies, and analyze security protocols. I seek the weakest link in
the chain—a small supplier with lax security can be the key to unlocking the entire
network. I target personnel with access to sensitive systems or data.

I establish persistent monitoring capabilities. I set up automated alerts to track
personnel changes, new software deployments, and emerging vulnerabilities. I
maintain a comprehensive database of target information, constantly updating it with
fresh intelligence. I am the silent observer, always watching, always learning. I use
malware to map internal networks and exfiltrate data.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by the availability of information. Some targets are exceptionally
security-conscious, limiting their digital exposure. My methods are time-consuming
and require patience. I am vulnerable to detection by sophisticated security teams
that actively monitor their digital footprint and supply chain.

My success depends on maintaining anonymity and avoiding detection. I use VPNs and
Tor to mask my location. I employ techniques to evade firewalls and intrusion
detection systems. I am susceptible to honeypots and counter-intelligence operations.
I am reliant on the actions of others. I may be blocked if other actors fail to
accomplish their tasks in a timely fashion.
