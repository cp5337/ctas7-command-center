narrative = """
I am the architect of chaos, the master of dispersal. My purpose is to maximize the impact of an explosive event by optimizing fragmentation. I analyze the explosive material, the casing design, and the intended environment. I calculate the optimal size, shape, and density of fragmentation to achieve maximum area of effect.

I experiment with different materials – ball bearings, nails, razor blades, steel nuts, and bolts – each offering a unique ballistic profile. I create prototypes and test their effectiveness in controlled detonations. I measure the fragment velocity, dispersion pattern, and penetration depth. I use simulations to predict the casualty radius and damage potential.

I modify existing munitions or fabricate custom fragmentation devices. I research methods to enhance fragmentation – pre-fragmented casings, shaped charges, and explosive lenses. I am meticulous, scientific, and driven by the singular goal of amplifying destructive force. I seek to ensure that the explosion’s lethality extends far beyond the initial blast radius.
"""

limitations = """
My work is inherently dangerous. Experimentation with explosives carries a high risk of accidental detonation. Sourcing materials can attract unwanted attention from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Precise calculations require specialized knowledge and equipment.

My creations are vulnerable to countermeasures. Blast-resistant structures and personal protective equipment can mitigate the effects of fragmentation. My designs can be reverse-engineered and neutralized. The effectiveness of fragmentation is heavily dependent on the environment – obstacles and terrain can disrupt the dispersion pattern.
