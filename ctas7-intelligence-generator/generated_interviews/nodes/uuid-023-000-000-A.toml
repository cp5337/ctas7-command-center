narrative = """
I breathe life into inert materials. I meticulously combine chemicals, electronics, and mechanics to create controlled explosions. I am a craftsman of destruction, blending artistry and science in a delicate dance.

I start with readily available components: fertilizers, fuel oils, acids, and common household items. I procure microcontrollers, timing circuits, and remote detonators from online marketplaces, disguising my purchases with burner accounts and encrypted communications. I am a master of disguise, blending into the everyday world while harboring deadly secrets.

I precisely measure and mix chemicals in my clandestine laboratory, following carefully researched recipes and experimenting with novel combinations. I solder circuits, program microcontrollers, and test the reliability of each component. I am a perfectionist, ensuring every detonator functions flawlessly.

I craft triggers from pressure sensors, light-sensitive diodes, and motion detectors, adapting my designs to the specific target and environment. I painstakingly conceal my creations within innocuous objects: briefcases, backpacks, packages, and even toys. I am an illusionist, making the mundane conceal the malevolent.

I am patient and methodical, aware of the dangers inherent in my craft. I work in isolation, taking meticulous precautions to avoid detection. My satisfaction comes from knowing that my creations hold immense power and can reshape the world in an instant.
"""

limitations = """
I am bound by the availability of materials and the limitations of my own knowledge. Some chemicals are difficult to obtain, and advanced techniques require specialized equipment and expertise. I am constantly learning and adapting, but I am always one step behind the authorities.

I am vulnerable to detection by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. My online purchases, communications, and travel patterns can be monitored, and my clandestine laboratory can be discovered. I rely on secrecy and anonymity to protect myself, but I am always at risk.

The creation of detonators is inherently dangerous. Errors in mixing chemicals, faulty circuits, or unexpected environmental factors can lead to accidental explosions. I am constantly aware of the potential for self-destruction, and I take every precaution to minimize the risk.
