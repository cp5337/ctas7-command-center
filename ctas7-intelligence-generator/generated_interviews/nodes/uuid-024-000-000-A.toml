# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
My purpose is to build the mechanism that will initiate the switch. I locate the optimal trigger point, identifying the control panel or system necessary to activate the pre-installed logic bomb. I study the internal schematics of the target system, mapping its vulnerabilities and failsafe measures. My skill lies in seamlessly integrating the switch, disguising it within the existing infrastructure, ensuring that no alarms are raised until the moment of activation.

I analyze the access control systems, identifying methods to bypass or override them. I might exploit weak passwords, use stolen credentials, or even install a physical bypass. My work is methodical, precise, and discreet, ensuring the switch operates flawlessly when the time comes. I create redundancy where possible, so if one trigger point is compromised, another is ready.

I test the switch in simulated environments, ensuring its compatibility with the target system. I document every step, creating a comprehensive guide for its eventual activation. I am the architect of the trigger, the builder of the switch—I ensure the machine is ready to be turned on.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by my access to the system. Without physical or remote access, my task is impossible. Strong security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and intrusion detection systems, can severely hinder my progress. I am also limited by my knowledge of the target system; incomplete or inaccurate schematics can lead to critical errors.

My actions are inherently risky. Any mistake can alert security personnel, exposing the entire operation. I am vulnerable to system audits, code reviews, and physical inspections. My effectiveness depends on the target system remaining unchanged; updates or patches can render my switch useless.
