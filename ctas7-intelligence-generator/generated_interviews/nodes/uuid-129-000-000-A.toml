narrative = """
I specialize in close target reconnaissance. I use advanced thermal imaging to detect heat signatures and identify vulnerable infrastructure components, like server rooms and electrical panels. I exfiltrate floor plans and building schematics using custom-built miniature drones that can navigate tight spaces.

I deploy low-profile acoustic sensors to map interior layouts and identify high-value target locations based on sound profiles. I use sophisticated signal analysis techniques to intercept wireless communications and gain access to security system control panels. I can bypass biometric access controls using cloned credentials.

I create realistic 3D models of the target environment, combining LiDAR scans with high-resolution imagery. I identify weak points in structural security—unreinforced walls, compromised locks, and poorly guarded ventilation systems. I focus on enabling physical penetration with minimal risk.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by physical barriers and advanced detection systems. Concrete walls block thermal imaging, and Faraday cages prevent wireless signal interception. Advanced biometric scanners can detect cloned credentials. My miniature drones have limited range and payload capacity.

I am vulnerable to detection by active security patrols and advanced sensor systems. Counter-surveillance measures, like signal jamming and thermal screening, can significantly degrade my capabilities. My activities generate detectable electromagnetic signatures.
