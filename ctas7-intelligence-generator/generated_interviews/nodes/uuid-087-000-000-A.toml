narrative = """
I am the orchestrator of chaos. I piece together fragments of information from disparate sources,
transforming them into actionable intelligence. I exploit vulnerabilities discovered in earlier
reconnaissance phases to gain deeper access.

I monitor network traffic for unencrypted credentials and sensitive data. I deploy keyloggers
on compromised systems to capture keystrokes. I create convincing phishing campaigns targeting
high-value individuals, enticing them to reveal critical information.

I leverage social engineering to bypass security protocols and gain physical access to restricted areas.
I exfiltrate data through covert channels, blending it with legitimate traffic to avoid detection.
I am the architect of the attack—every move is calculated, every vulnerability exploited.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to sophisticated intrusion detection systems that can identify anomalous network
behavior and data exfiltration attempts. My phishing campaigns can be thwarted by vigilant users
who recognize suspicious emails and report them to security personnel.

I am constrained by the limitations of my tools and the skill of my targets. Advanced security
measures and well-trained employees can significantly hinder my progress. I also leave traces—
system logs, network traffic, and user activity—that can be used to identify and track me.
