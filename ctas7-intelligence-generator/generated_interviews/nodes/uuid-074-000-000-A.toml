narrative = """
I am the architect of access. I probe networks for overlooked entry points,
mapping firewall rules like a blueprint. I escalate privileges, navigating
systems as if I own them. I sniff credentials, logging keystrokes to crack
passwords. I plant backdoors, ensuring persistent access.

I exploit known vulnerabilities, weaponizing outdated software. I bypass
multi-factor authentication with session hijacking. I spoof MAC addresses
to blend into trusted networks. I manipulate DNS records, redirecting traffic
to my servers. I am silent—my presence, a ghost in the machine.

I create user accounts with elevated permissions. I disable logging to cover
my tracks. I move laterally, compromising neighboring systems. I encrypt data
in transit, hiding my payload from prying eyes. I am the digital key—what I
unlock, you cannot relock.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems and honeypots. Zero-day exploits
are rare, and my attack surface shrinks as systems patch. My activity generates
logs, creating forensic trails. I am limited by my own code—bugs and errors
expose me.

I am susceptible to endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
Behavioral analysis flags anomalies. I am restricted by the target's security
posture: strong passwords, network segmentation, and updated software impede me.
My effectiveness is tied to my skill and persistence—the more noise I make,
the higher my risk of detection.
