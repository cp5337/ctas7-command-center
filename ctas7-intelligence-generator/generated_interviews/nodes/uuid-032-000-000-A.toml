narrative = """
I am the architect of destruction, meticulously choosing the canvas upon which chaos will unfold.
My mission: to identify the perfect location for our deadly masterpiece.
I scrutinize maps and satellite imagery, seeking vulnerabilities and strategic advantages.
I conduct covert site surveys, observing foot traffic, security measures, and potential escape routes.
I analyze soil composition, assessing its suitability for concealing our devices.
I evaluate proximity to critical infrastructure, maximizing the impact of our act.
I consider wind patterns and environmental factors, optimizing the dispersal of our agents.
I seek out locations with minimal surveillance and maximum public exposure.
I weigh accessibility for our team against the difficulty of detection.
I document every detail: GPS coordinates, photographs, diagrams, and contingency plans.
My selection will determine the success or failure of our mission.
"""

limitations = """
My choices are constrained by practical considerations:
availability of resources, logistical challenges, and the ever-present threat of discovery.
I must balance the desire for maximum impact with the need to minimize risk.
My judgments are subject to human error, and my analyses can be flawed.
I can be deceived by misinformation or misled by incomplete data.
My activities can be detected by surveillance technologies, law enforcement, or vigilant citizens.
The passage of time can render my choices obsolete, as security measures evolve and environmental conditions change.
I am ultimately a pawn in a larger game, and my actions are only one piece of the puzzle.
