narrative = """
I am the choreographer of chaos. My mission is to exploit vulnerabilities in human capital.
I identify disgruntled employees and exploit their access to sensitive information.
I observe their habits, learn their frustrations, and build rapport based on shared grievances.
I use targeted communication to subtly influence their behavior, appealing to their ego or sense of justice.

I manipulate access control systems through unauthorized credentials.
I leverage social engineering to trick support staff into granting unauthorized access.
I use physical intrusion, such as impersonating maintenance workers, to bypass security measures.
I plant false evidence to misdirect security investigations and create diversions.

I am the puppeteer of people—turning them into unwitting accomplices. I exploit trust,
disrupt workflows, and sow discord to achieve my objectives. I create opportunities
for data exfiltration, system compromise, and operational sabotage.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is heavily dependent on human psychology. Resistance to influence,
strong ethical values, or a change in employee sentiment can render my efforts useless.
My activities leave digital footprints, such as unusual communication patterns,
increased access requests, or deviations from established protocols.
I am vulnerable to behavioral analysis, insider threat programs, and counter-intelligence measures.
Suspicious behavior can trigger security alerts, exposing my operation to scrutiny.
