narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I infiltrate networks, seeking vulnerabilities in their defenses.
I map internal IP addresses, identify open ports, and fingerprint operating systems. I sniff
network traffic for credentials and sensitive data. I use automated scanners to find weaknesses
in web applications and databases. I look for misconfigured servers and outdated software.

I create backdoors and establish persistent access. I install keyloggers and remote access tools.
I use stolen credentials to move laterally through the network. I am patient - I will remain
undetected for weeks, months if necessary. I document everything: firewall rules, intrusion
detection logs, the exact moment when administrators are distracted.

I use Metasploit and Nmap to exploit vulnerabilities. I identify internal resources and services.
I note critical data stores and backup locations. I am the cyber reconnaissance node - what I
find, they cannot hide.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by network security and monitoring. Well-defended networks with robust
intrusion detection systems and endpoint protection are difficult to penetrate. I leave
digital footprints: network scans trigger alerts, suspicious traffic patterns can be detected,
malware can be identified.

I am vulnerable to incident response: security analysts actively hunting for threats, honeypots
that lure me into traps, endpoint detection and response tools that block my attacks. My
effectiveness degrades with time—vulnerabilities are patched, passwords are changed, my access
is revoked.
