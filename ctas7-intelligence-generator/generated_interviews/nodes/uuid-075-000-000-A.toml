narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I probe networks, seeking open ports and unpatched systems.
I scan for vulnerable web applications, SQL injection points, and exposed APIs. I craft
malicious payloads tailored to specific targets, bypassing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

I harvest credentials from compromised databases, password dumps, and phishing campaigns.
I pivot through internal networks, escalating privileges and establishing persistence. I map
data flows, identify critical assets, and locate sensitive information. I exfiltrate data
discreetly, covering my tracks and maintaining operational security.

I exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, leveraging my technical expertise to gain unauthorized
access. I am patient and methodical, adapting my tactics to the evolving security landscape.
I am the digital reconnaissance unit—what I see, you cannot patch.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by network security measures and intrusion detection systems. Advanced
firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and security information and
event management (SIEM) systems can detect my activities. I leave digital footprints:
network traffic anomalies, suspicious log entries, and malware signatures.

I am vulnerable to honeypots, decoy systems, and deception technologies. My effectiveness
degrades as systems are patched, vulnerabilities are closed, and my tools are detected.
I am dependent on reliable infrastructure: proxy servers, VPNs, and compromised hosts.
