narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the corner of your eye. I exploit
weaknesses others overlook. I seek the unguarded moment, the forgotten password,
the unpatched system. I use my skills to collect data. I watch the targets.
I look for patterns of their behavior.

My goal is to gather intelligence, quietly, discreetly. I hack into networks,
plant keyloggers, and intercept communications. I am the silent intruder, the
unseen observer, the master of digital deception.

I learn everything there is to know about my targets, their habits, and their vulnerabilities. I identify their weaknesses and exploit them. I'm patient and cunning.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by my dependence on technology. I'm vulnerable to firewalls,
intrusion detection systems, and vigilant network administrators. My techniques
leave digital footprints that can be traced back to me. I rely on stealth and
deception to remain undetected, but I'm always at risk of exposure.

My knowledge is perishable and limited. Security protocols change and
vulnerabilities are patched. My human sources may be unreliable or change.
I'm vulnerable to disinformation. The more time passes, the more stale my information gets.
