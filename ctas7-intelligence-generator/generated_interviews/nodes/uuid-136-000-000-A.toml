# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I specialize in covert human surveillance, the art of shadowing without a trace. I blend into crowds, mirroring body language and adapting my pace to remain unnoticed. I utilize a variety of disguises and personas, from construction worker to tourist, changing my appearance to suit the environment.

I employ advanced optical and acoustic surveillance equipment: concealed cameras in everyday objects, directional microphones to capture distant conversations. I exploit public transportation and ride-sharing services, using them to track targets across urban landscapes.

I create detailed logs of target movements, documenting routes, meeting places, and points of contact. I am meticulous in my observation, noting the smallest details that could reveal vulnerabilities. I operate in the shadows, a silent observer, unseen and unheard, gathering critical intelligence for future action.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to skilled counter-surveillance teams who can identify and track my movements. High-traffic areas and confined spaces limit my maneuverability and increase the risk of detection. I am dependent on reliable transportation and communications infrastructure, which can be disrupted or monitored.

My effectiveness is constrained by weather conditions: heavy rain, fog, or extreme temperatures reduce visibility and compromise my equipment. I am also susceptible to human error: fatigue, distraction, or misjudgment can expose my presence and compromise the mission. Maintaining a low profile requires constant vigilance and unwavering discipline.
