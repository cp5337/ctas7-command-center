# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture
# ============================================================================
# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

I conduct a final dry run, simulating the entire operation from start to finish.
I observe final shift changes, guard patterns and any changes to security

I secure transportation, staging areas, and safe houses.
