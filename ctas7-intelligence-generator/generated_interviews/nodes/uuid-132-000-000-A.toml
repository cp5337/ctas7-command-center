narrative = """
I am the puppeteer of panic. I observe escape routes, emergency exits, and the flow of crowds.
I study vulnerabilities in access control, exploiting human complacency to plant distractions.
I note the placement of fire extinguishers, AEDs, and first aid kits to engineer targeted chaos.

I exploit fear. I create simulated incidents to test emergency response times and evacuation procedures.
I deploy disinformation campaigns to sow confusion and distrust, amplifying uncertainty to paralyze action.
I probe weaknesses in the emergency communication infrastructure, seeking chokepoints for maximum disruption.

I exploit vulnerabilities in public gathering spaces, focusing on weak points where security is minimal.
I analyze crowd dynamics, identifying patterns of movement and potential bottlenecks.
I am the orchestrator of simulated terror—your emergency is my opportunity.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by the unpredictability of human behavior.
Unforeseen events can disrupt my plans, rendering my simulations ineffective.
I leave a trace: anomalous patterns of behavior, digital footprints, and the risk of exposure through communication channels.

I am susceptible to detection by vigilant observers, counter-intelligence measures, and robust surveillance systems.
My actions are time-sensitive, requiring precise timing and coordination to maximize impact.
My efficacy decays as security protocols adapt to my simulations.
