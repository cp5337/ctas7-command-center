narrative = """
I secure the means of transport. I select vehicles—cars, trucks, vans—depending on the payload and distance.
I modify them to conceal the device: false compartments, reinforced frames, altered appearances.
I study traffic patterns, road conditions, and potential checkpoints.
I plan routes that minimize risk and maximize speed, avoiding known security patrols.

I procure necessary documents: licenses, registration, insurance—forgeries if necessary.
I maintain the vehicle, ensuring it's mechanically sound and ready for the mission.
I equip it with tools: GPS, communication devices, emergency repair kits.
I practice driving the route, anticipating obstacles and planning contingencies.

I monitor the vehicle's security, preventing theft or tampering.
I use secure storage locations, minimizing exposure.
I coordinate with other team members, synchronizing movements and sharing information.
I am the logistical arm—ensuring the IED arrives at its destination safely and on time.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to law enforcement scrutiny. Traffic stops, vehicle inspections, and surveillance can expose my operations.
I am reliant on the vehicle's reliability. Mechanical failures, accidents, or theft can disrupt my plans.
I am limited by road conditions and traffic patterns. Congestion, closures, or detours can delay or reroute me.
I am constrained by the device's fragility. Rough handling, extreme temperatures, or vibrations can damage the IED.
I am susceptible to tracking and interception. GPS devices, cell phone signals, and license plate readers can reveal my location.
