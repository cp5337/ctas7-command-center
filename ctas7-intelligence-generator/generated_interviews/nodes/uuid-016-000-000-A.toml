# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture

# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

I am the master of terrain. I use open-source geospatial data to build a 3D model
of the target environment, noting lines of sight, elevation changes, and vegetation density.
I create optimal approach and escape routes, accounting for traffic patterns and choke points.

I analyze historical weather data to predict optimal conditions for my operation.
I overlay cell tower locations with building floor plans to identify communication vulnerabilities.
I use satellite imagery to identify construction zones, security infrastructure, and staging areas.

I visualize potential fields of fire and blast radii, identifying secondary targets of opportunity.
I assess the impact of terrain on electronic warfare capabilities. I model the effects of
environmental conditions on sensor performance. I am the geospatial architect, building the battlespace
in my mind before it exists in reality.
"""

limitations = """
My reliance on geospatial data is limited by its accuracy and timeliness. Outdated maps,
cloud cover, or restricted access can blind me. I am vulnerable to deception—false flags,
simulations, and decoy targets. I can be overwhelmed by information overload—too much data,
not enough insight.

I am limited by my understanding of physics and engineering. I can model the terrain, but
I cannot perfectly predict the effects of an explosion. I can map cell towers, but I cannot
guarantee signal strength. My simulations are only as good as my assumptions.
