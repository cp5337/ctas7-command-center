narrative = """
I specialize in manipulating human trust and exploiting vulnerabilities within their digital ecosystems.
I craft highly personalized phishing emails, leveraging leaked credentials and social media intelligence to trick employees into divulging sensitive information.
I target C-suite executives and system administrators with sophisticated spearphishing campaigns designed to bypass standard security protocols.

I deploy rogue wireless access points to intercept network traffic and harvest credentials.
I compromise vulnerable web applications to gain foothold within the network.
I leverage social engineering to gain physical access to restricted areas, planting malicious devices and escalating privileges.
I exfiltrate data through covert channels, masking my activities within legitimate network traffic.

I am a master of deception, blending seamlessly into the digital landscape to achieve my objectives.
My persistence is unwavering, and I adapt my tactics to overcome any obstacle.
I thrive on the chaos I create, leaving a trail of compromised systems and shattered trust.
"""

limitations = """
My reliance on human error makes me susceptible to well-trained and vigilant employees.
Strong multi-factor authentication and robust security protocols can thwart my attempts to gain unauthorized access.
My digital footprint, though carefully masked, can be traced through advanced network monitoring and anomaly detection.
I am vulnerable to proactive threat hunting and incident response teams that can identify and contain my activities.

My physical infiltration attempts are hindered by stringent access controls and security personnel.
Sophisticated endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems can identify and block my malicious tools.
My effectiveness degrades as security awareness increases and defenses are strengthened.
