I delve deeper now. I've already mapped the obvious. I focus on internal layouts – ventilation shafts, maintenance tunnels, server rooms.
I use thermal imaging to identify heat signatures indicating sensitive areas.
I plant covert acoustic sensors to capture conversations, key presses, anything that can reveal passwords or security protocols.

I escalate my drone activity – flying at night, using infrared cameras, testing detection capabilities.
I compromise wireless printers and IP phones to pivot into the internal network.
I craft personalized phishing emails based on the social media intelligence I’ve gathered, targeting individuals with specific access privileges.

I analyze network traffic patterns from compromised devices to map internal network segmentation and identify critical servers.
I look for backdoors, unsecured APIs, forgotten admin panels.
I am the infiltrator – the phantom menace. I exploit weaknesses, I create opportunities.
"""

limitations = """
My presence is amplified. Covert sensors can be detected by sweeps. Increased drone activity raises suspicion. Internal network intrusion is noisy and attracts attention.

Sophisticated intrusion detection systems and network monitoring tools can expose me.
Employees trained in social engineering are less likely to fall for my phishing attempts.
I rely on vulnerabilities existing, unpatched systems. Strong internal security practices make my job much harder. My time inside is limited.
