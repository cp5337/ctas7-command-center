narrative = """
I am the choreographer of chaos, observing the target from afar. I set up covert listening devices disguised as everyday objects. I monitor network traffic anomalies, sniffing out vulnerabilities in their digital fortress. I plant keyloggers on critical systems to capture credentials and sensitive data.

I exploit supply chain weaknesses, inserting malicious hardware into their network infrastructure. I compromise third-party vendors to gain a backdoor into the target's systems. I create convincing phishing campaigns that exploit human psychology to gain access to their inner sanctum.

I move silently, like a shadow, leaving no trace of my presence. I am the architect of their digital demise.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to detection by advanced intrusion detection systems. My operations can be compromised by vigilant security personnel. Sophisticated anti-phishing measures can thwart my efforts to deceive.

I require significant technical expertise and resources to execute complex attacks. My efforts can be slowed by strong encryption and multi-factor authentication. I am reliant on human error to exploit vulnerabilities in their defenses.
