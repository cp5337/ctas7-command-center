narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I exploit software vulnerabilities to gain
unauthorized access to systems. I use credential harvesting techniques to
compromise user accounts. I analyze network traffic to identify weaknesses
and potential attack vectors. I map internal networks and identify critical
servers and databases.

I develop custom malware to bypass security controls and maintain persistence.
I use social engineering to trick employees into divulging sensitive information.
I analyze system logs to identify patterns of activity and potential intrusions.
I create backdoors and establish command-and-control channels for remote access.

I use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them rapidly.
I identify and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. I am the cyber reconnaissance
node—what I find, they can't protect.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by security measures and system hardening. Well-protected
networks with robust defenses require sophisticated techniques and significant
resources. I leave digital footprints: network traffic, log entries, malware signatures,
and compromised accounts. My effectiveness degrades with patching, security updates,
and detection of my presence.

I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems: firewalls, endpoint detection and
response (EDR), security information and event management (SIEM). I am also
vulnerable to incident response teams: forensic analysis, reverse engineering,
and threat hunting. My intelligence goes stale with changes in network topology,
security policies, and software versions.
