narrative = """
I am the sculptor of deception, molding reality to my advantage. I specialize in advanced persistent reconnaissance, establishing long-term observation posts, both physical and virtual. My team deploys distributed sensor networks – Raspberry Pi-based cameras disguised as innocuous objects, strategically placed to capture key entry points and high-value targets. I don't just observe; I learn.

I leverage AI-powered facial recognition to identify key personnel and track their movements. I exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices to create covert listening posts within the target environment. I build custom network taps and packet sniffers to intercept sensitive communications. My operations are designed to be stealthy, patient, and comprehensive.

I create detailed 3D models of target facilities using LiDAR scanning and photogrammetry. I analyze building blueprints and schematics to identify hidden passages and vulnerabilities. I infiltrate security systems to disable alarms and manipulate surveillance feeds. I am the architect of access, building the pathways to exploit. My methods are subtle, my reach extensive.
"""

limitations = """
My advanced techniques require specialized expertise and equipment, increasing operational costs and complexity. My dependence on technology makes me vulnerable to technical countermeasures: intrusion detection systems, network monitoring, and anti-surveillance technology. My physical surveillance is limited by the laws of physics: line of sight, weather conditions, and human fatigue.

I am susceptible to detection by advanced counter-intelligence operations: honey pots, decoy systems, and behavioral analysis. My reliance on insider access introduces the risk of betrayal or compromise. My custom-built tools are vulnerable to reverse engineering and exploitation. My operations leave digital footprints, which can be traced back to my organization.
