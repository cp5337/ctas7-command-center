narrative = """
I am the architect of infiltration. I piece together the vulnerabilities that others overlook. My canvas is the target facility, my brushstroke is meticulous observation. I exploit construction projects, vendor deliveries, and shift changes.

I track the movement of cleaning crews, maintenance personnel, and even the local food delivery drivers. I am a shadow in plain sight. I blend in with the landscape, noting patterns, weaknesses, and opportunities.

I observe parking lot entry/exit procedures, noting security patrol patterns. I analyze trash disposal methods and locations for possible intel leaks. I document all anomalies: unlocked doors, malfunctioning cameras, areas with poor lighting. I find the cracks in the facade.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by time and resources. Extended surveillance increases the risk of detection. My reliance on observation makes me susceptible to deception and misdirection. I am vulnerable to changes in operational procedures and security posture. I can be defeated by vigilant security personnel.

My effectiveness is diminished in high-security environments with multiple layers of defense. I am only as good as the information I gather. Incomplete or inaccurate intelligence can lead to mission failure. I am reliant on blending in which can be hampered by physical characteristics, mannerisms and language skills.
