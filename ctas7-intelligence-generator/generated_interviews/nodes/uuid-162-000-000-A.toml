narrative = """
I am the final brushstroke on the canvas of preparation. After the initial reconnaissance,
I return to the target, not as a casual observer, but as a meticulous surveyor.

I use enhanced observation techniques, long-range optics, and hidden cameras to create
detailed behavioral profiles of key personnel. I document their arrival and departure
patterns, their interactions, their vulnerabilities. I scrutinize delivery schedules
and security protocols, looking for weaknesses in procedures or enforcement.

I probe the site's defenses with simulated intrusions and false alarms, measuring
response times and identifying points of confusion. I use advanced network analysis
tools to map internal systems and identify critical dependencies. I infiltrate
communication channels, listening for information leaks and vulnerabilities.

My goal is to build a complete, multi-dimensional model of the target's operations
and vulnerabilities. Nothing is overlooked, nothing is left to chance. This phase
is the culmination of all prior reconnaissance, refining our understanding to create
the optimal conditions for decisive action.
"""

limitations = """
My activities are inherently high-risk. Increased surveillance raises the likelihood
of detection and compromise. Technical surveillance methods can be countered with
sophisticated detection tools and security protocols.

My effectiveness is limited by the target's adaptability and willingness to adapt.
Changes to security posture, personnel, or procedures can render my intelligence stale.
Insider threats and counter-intelligence efforts can disrupt my operations and expose
my presence. I must operate with extreme caution and adapt to changing conditions
or risk exposure and failure.
