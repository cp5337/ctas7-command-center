narrative = """
I am the architect of deception, constructing elaborate scenarios to gain access.
I impersonate maintenance workers, delivery personnel, or even potential clients.
I use forged credentials, stolen uniforms, and confident demeanor to bypass security.

I exploit social engineering techniques to manipulate employees into revealing information or granting access.
I observe security protocols and exploit weaknesses in the system. I use fake service requests or equipment inspections to get inside restricted areas. I'm looking for the cracks, the vulnerabilities masked behind a facade of control.

I install covert listening devices or cameras to gather intelligence on secure rooms or critical processes.
I document access codes and security vulnerabilities.
I photograph sensitive documents and equipment schematics. My goal is to become an invisible operator, turning their own security against them.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is highly dependent on human psychology and the target's security awareness.
Sophisticated security systems and well-trained personnel significantly increase the risk of detection. I rely on luck, timing and the target's negligence.
I am vulnerable to background checks, security audits, and counter-intelligence operations.
My forged credentials and impersonations can be exposed, leading to arrest and prosecution.
