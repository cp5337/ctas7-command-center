narrative = """
I am the ghost in the machine, the shadow in the alley. I exploit vulnerabilities
discovered in Phase 1 to deepen my access. I plant keyloggers on administrative
computers, sniff network traffic for credentials, and use rogue access points to
intercept communications. I compromise security cameras, turning their eyes away,
or even feeding false images.

I map the internal network, identifying critical servers and data stores. I scan
for open ports and unpatched systems. I exploit weak passwords and default
configurations. I move laterally, escalating privileges, creating backdoors,
and covering my tracks.

I establish persistent remote access. I exfiltrate sensitive data incrementally,
blending it into normal network traffic. I am the silent infiltrator—unseen,
undetected, and unstoppable. I prepare the battlefield for the final assault.
"""

limitations = """
My success depends on the weaknesses I found in Phase 1. If they've patched their
systems, strengthened their passwords, and tightened their security, my task
becomes exponentially harder. My tools can be detected: keyloggers generate
anomalous activity, rogue access points emit telltale signals, and unusual network
traffic raises alarms.

I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, endpoint detection and response
tools, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems. My presence
can be revealed by forensic analysis, packet capture, and log correlation. If
discovered, my access will be revoked, and my operation compromised.
