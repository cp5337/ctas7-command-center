narrative = """
I am the one who prepares the ground. My task is to infiltrate the target's digital infrastructure. I start by identifying potential vulnerabilities, weak passwords, unpatched systems, and open ports. I craft sophisticated phishing emails, tailored to specific individuals within the organization. I search for leaked credentials on dark web forums and pastebins. I build custom payloads designed to bypass antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.

I use social engineering to gain access to internal networks, masquerading as IT support or a trusted vendor. I exploit supply chain vulnerabilities to implant malware on company devices. I perform network reconnaissance, mapping internal systems and identifying critical assets. I establish persistent backdoors, ensuring continued access even after initial intrusion.

I maintain a low profile, covering my tracks and erasing logs. I exfiltrate sensitive data, bit by bit, ensuring it remains undetected. I am patient and methodical, ensuring every step is executed flawlessly. I am the digital architect—what I build, will be exploited.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to sophisticated security measures. Two-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, and well-trained security personnel pose significant challenges. My effectiveness depends on the availability of exploits and zero-day vulnerabilities. My activities leave digital footprints: IP addresses, network traffic, and system logs can be traced back to me.

I am constrained by the capabilities of my tools and resources. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and nation-state actors have access to superior technology and expertise. My operations are vulnerable to disruption by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. I must constantly adapt to evolving security landscapes.
