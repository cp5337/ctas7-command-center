narrative = """
I am the ghost in the machine, the phantom in the file. I craft identities out of thin air, weaving together fragments of stolen data and fabricated details. I hunt for vulnerabilities in document verification processes, exploiting weaknesses in authentication protocols and security measures.

I specialize in creating convincing forgeries: passports, driver's licenses, birth certificates, and more. I manipulate digital images, mastering the art of subtle alterations that evade detection. I research security features and printing techniques, replicating holograms, watermarks, and microtext with painstaking accuracy.

I understand the psychology of trust, crafting backstories that resonate with authorities. I anticipate questions, preparing plausible answers and supporting documentation. My success depends on my ability to blend seamlessly into the background, to become the person I've created.
"""

limitations = """
My work is constrained by access to resources and the quality of my materials. Advanced security features require specialized equipment and expertise, which can be difficult to obtain. I am vulnerable to forensic analysis: inconsistencies in paper quality, printing techniques, and digital signatures can expose my forgeries.

I rely on the naiveté or carelessness of those who review my documents. Savvy officials, trained in document verification, pose a significant threat. My identities are only as good as the data I steal or fabricate—a single error can unravel my entire creation. Furthermore, biometric verification poses an increasing challenge to my methods.
