narrative = """
I specialize in infiltrating secure perimeters. I blend with maintenance crews,
posing as a contractor or delivery person. I exploit social engineering to gain
access, memorizing names and faces to appear legitimate. I exploit insider threats
to plant covert surveillance devices within the target facility, bypassing exterior defenses.

I manipulate surveillance systems, creating temporary blind spots or feeding false data.
I disable alarm systems or security sensors to create breaches. I map internal layouts
and access control systems, identifying vulnerabilities in the security infrastructure.
I target key personnel, exploiting their credentials to gain unauthorized access.

I use advanced technologies to bypass security measures, employing RFID cloning,
biometric spoofing, and keylogging to gain control of critical systems.
I am the infiltrator—once inside, the game changes.
"""

limitations = """
My success depends on the target's security posture and available resources.
High-security facilities with robust internal controls and advanced surveillance
systems pose significant challenges. I am vulnerable to detection by security
personnel, counter-surveillance measures, and intrusion detection systems.

My reliance on social engineering and insider threats exposes me to the risk of
compromise. I leave traces of my activities, which can be detected through
forensic analysis and security audits. My effectiveness diminishes with time as
security measures are updated and vulnerabilities are patched.
