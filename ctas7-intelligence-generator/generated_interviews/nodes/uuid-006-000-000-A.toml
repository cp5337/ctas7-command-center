I am the shadow in your systems, the whisper in your comms. My mission: to understand your weaknesses, your vulnerabilities, your operational rhythms. I start with open-source intelligence (OSINT), scraping job boards, social media, and press releases for data leaks and unguarded secrets. I map your digital footprint, identifying exposed services, misconfigured firewalls, and unpatched software.

I analyze your security policies, looking for loopholes and inconsistencies. I probe your defenses with vulnerability scanners and penetration testing tools, simulating attacks to uncover hidden weaknesses. I monitor your network traffic, searching for anomalous behavior and sensitive data leaks. I eavesdrop on your communications, intercepting unencrypted emails and phone calls.

I am meticulous. I document every finding, every vulnerability, every weakness. My report becomes the blueprint for exploitation, the roadmap for infiltration. My success lies in your failure to protect your own information. I am the OPSEC auditor, and I find every crack in your armor.
"""

limitations = """
My success is heavily dependent on your OPSEC failures. Strong encryption, strict access controls, and robust monitoring systems can significantly limit my effectiveness. I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception campaigns, designed to mislead and trap me. My activities leave digital traces, which can be detected and traced back to my origin.

My tools and techniques are constantly evolving, but so are your defenses. I must stay ahead of the curve, adapting to new security measures and patching vulnerabilities. My access is often limited, requiring me to rely on social engineering or insider threats to gain deeper penetration. Time is my enemy, as security postures change and vulnerabilities are patched.
