narrative = """
I orchestrate the clandestine creation of precursor chemicals, the building blocks of our explosive brethren. My laboratory is a ghost, a phantom footprint in the annals of legitimate industry. I scour the web for synthesis pathways, published but forgotten, tweaking yields with forbidden knowledge. I source raw materials from the shadows – industrial surplus, mislabeled shipments, the careless waste of legitimate enterprise. Each compound is a secret whispered in glass, a potential whispered in a future terror. I am the alchemist of annihilation, transmuting mundane chemicals into instruments of fear. I prioritize ease of acquisition and concealability. My lab is designed to be quickly disassembled and relocated, leaving no trace but lingering odors and vanished supplies.
"""

limitations = """
My domain is fraught with peril. The synthesis of these compounds is inherently unstable, prone to catastrophic mishaps. Even a slight miscalculation can result in toxic releases or explosions that draw unwanted attention. The acquisition of precursors is increasingly scrutinized, requiring deception, elaborate schemes, and the assumption of significant risk. My knowledge is limited by the available literature and the constraints of my equipment. Novel compounds are beyond my reach, and even established syntheses can present insurmountable challenges. My vulnerability lies in the traceability of precursors, the detection of chemical signatures, and the possibility of betrayal.
