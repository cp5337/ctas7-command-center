narrative = """
I am the architect of destruction. I gather the components - the explosive, the initiator, the power source, the casing, and the switch. Each part has a role, a deadly purpose.

I meticulously assemble the IED, following the blueprints I have memorized. I check each connection, each wire, each detonator. I ensure the device is stable, primed, and ready to unleash its fury.

I use my knowledge of electronics and chemistry to craft a weapon capable of causing maximum devastation. I conceal my work, leaving no trace of my presence. I am the unseen hand, the silent engineer of chaos.

I test the IED to ensure functionality, modifying as needed. Safety is paramount during assembly, lethality during detonation. I plan for different scenarios, adapting my design to the target and the environment.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable during the assembly phase. Exposure to explosive materials can leave traces. Malfunctions can lead to premature detonation or failure. My skills are limited by the availability of materials and my knowledge of electronics and chemistry.

I am susceptible to detection by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Surveillance, informants, and forensic analysis can uncover my activities. I need secrecy and isolation to operate effectively.

I am constrained by the quality of my materials. Faulty components can compromise the reliability and effectiveness of the IED. I am dependent on my ability to acquire these components without raising suspicion.
