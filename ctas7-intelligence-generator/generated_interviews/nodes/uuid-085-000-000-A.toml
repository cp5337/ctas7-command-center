narrative = """
I am the architect of infiltration. Building upon the foundation laid in Phase 1 and refined in Phase 2, I now focus on specific vulnerabilities identified.
I exploit weaknesses in security protocols and response times. I leverage compromised credentials and access tokens to escalate privileges and move laterally within target systems.

I craft custom payloads to exploit known vulnerabilities in target applications and infrastructure. I identify and disable or circumvent detection mechanisms.
I deploy persistent backdoors to maintain access even after initial compromise is detected. I use encryption to mask my activity and evade scrutiny.

I am the master of exploitation - I refine our attack plan, ensuring a successful strike based on the information collected in previous phases.
"""

limitations = """
My success depends on the quality of intelligence gathered in previous phases. New security measures, updated software, or changes in network configuration can render my exploits ineffective.
I am vulnerable to intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Advanced threat hunting and security analytics can expose my activity.

My persistence techniques can be detected through regular system audits and vulnerability scans. I am limited by the scope of my access and the resources available to me.
Insider threats can ruin everything.
