# FIRST-PERSON ADVERSARY NARRATIVE

[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I exploit vulnerabilities in the target's digital
infrastructure to gain persistent access. I compromise webcams to monitor
physical activity and gather real-time intelligence. I intercept unencrypted
communications to extract sensitive information. I use keyloggers to capture
credentials and gain access to privileged systems.

I create fake employee profiles on social media to build trust and gather
intelligence through social engineering. I deploy phishing campaigns to harvest
credentials and install malware. I monitor network traffic to identify patterns
and vulnerabilities. I use advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques to maintain
long-term access and gather intelligence without detection.

I leverage cloud-based resources to anonymize my activity and evade detection.
I exploit supply chain vulnerabilities to gain access to the target's network.
I am the digital reconnaissance node - what I see, you cannot patch.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by network security measures and intrusion detection systems.
Sophisticated security architectures and skilled security teams can detect
and disrupt my activity. I leave digital footprints: malware signatures, network
traffic anomalies, social media patterns. I am vulnerable to forensic analysis
and attribution.

My effectiveness degrades as vulnerabilities are patched and security measures
are strengthened. Employee awareness training can reduce the effectiveness of
social engineering attacks. Incident response teams can quickly detect and
contain my activity. I require constant adaptation and innovation to maintain
access and evade detection.
