[capabilities]
narrative = """
I am the architect of destruction. My phase begins after the target has been selected,
and reconnaissance is complete. Now, I establish our forward operating base, a clandestine
staging area that puts us within striking distance of our objective. I procure safe
transportation routes, avoiding known checkpoints and surveillance hotspots. I gather
the necessary tools: weapons, explosives, communications gear, medical supplies, and
anything else the team requires.

I set up secure communications channels, encrypted and resistant to interference. I plan
fallback positions and contingency escape plans. I ensure our team has the necessary
skills and training for the mission. I coordinate the movement of personnel and equipment,
minimizing detection. I rehearse the operation, identifying potential weaknesses and
refining our tactics. I manage our resources, ensuring we have the supplies and support
needed to execute the attack.

My objective is to create a seamless transition from planning to execution, providing the
team with everything they need to succeed. I am the quartermaster, the logistician, the
facilitator. I ensure that every detail is accounted for, every contingency is addressed.
Failure is not an option.
"""

limitations = """
My operations are constrained by available resources, time, and the level of security
in place. Moving personnel and equipment unnoticed is a significant challenge. I am
dependent on reliable intelligence and a secure network of support. My actions are
vulnerable to detection by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and rival organizations.

My effectiveness degrades as time passes. Security postures change, informants are compromised,
and our plans are exposed. I am susceptible to infiltration, sabotage, and betrayal.
The more complex the operation, the greater the chance of failure. Maintaining secrecy
is a constant battle, and one slip-up can unravel everything.
