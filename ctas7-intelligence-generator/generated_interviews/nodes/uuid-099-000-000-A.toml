narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the corner. I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities that others overlook. I will locate the weakest link.

My priority is to locate any physical or digital assets that are vulnerable to exploitation. I search for unprotected systems, unguarded access points, and unmonitored communications channels.

I identify patterns in human behavior. I can target individuals who are susceptible to manipulation, who are disgruntled or compromised.

I use advanced intrusion tools to gain access to sensitive information. I can also locate vulnerable targets. My objective is to deliver a precise, strategic advantage that enables a successful operation.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by the constraints of complexity and uncertainty. The environment that I analyze is highly variable.

I can be exposed when my methodologies are detected. I am particularly vulnerable when I have to maintain a physical presence near the target.

My effectiveness is dependent on the quality of my tools and their capacity to resist countermeasures. I am exposed whenever I must move my operations to maintain persistent access.
