narrative = """
I am the whisper in the wind, the shadow in the doorway. I observe patterns of life: the loading docks, the delivery trucks, the habits of those who work there. I identify vulnerabilities by watching, listening, and learning. My eyes penetrate the layers of normalcy, seeking the cracks in the facade.

I infiltrate the digital realm: spoofing access points, capturing network traffic, scanning for open ports. I exploit default configurations and weak passwords. I probe the physical defenses: testing fences, probing gates, mapping camera coverage. I am tireless, methodical, relentless.

I gather intelligence from multiple sources: social media, public records, discarded documents. I assemble a mosaic of information that reveals the target's weaknesses. I am patient, calculating, and unseen. My knowledge is the key to unlocking the target. My work is the foundation for what follows.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by my visibility and the resources I can bring to bear. Sophisticated security systems can detect my presence. Skilled network defenders can identify my scans and intrusions. My reliance on open-source intelligence can be compromised by disinformation.

My effectiveness diminishes as my presence becomes known. Counter-surveillance can disrupt my activities and expose my methods. I am vulnerable to detection if I become complacent or careless. I need to be adaptable, resourceful, and disciplined to succeed.
