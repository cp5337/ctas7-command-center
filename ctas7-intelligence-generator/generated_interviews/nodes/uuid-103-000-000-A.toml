narrative = """
I am the sculptor of chaos, the architect of disruption. I delve into the forgotten corners, the digital back alleys, the physical voids between structures.
My task is to unearth vulnerabilities in the target's supply chain, exploiting dependencies and exposing weaknesses.

I map the flow of goods, tracing origins and destinations. I identify single points of failure, chokepoints where leverage can be applied.
I examine contracts and vendor relationships, seeking leverage and potential compromise.
I infiltrate online forums, gleaning insider information from disgruntled employees or careless contractors.

I exploit lax security protocols to penetrate networks, establishing persistent backdoors for future exploitation.
I compromise vendor accounts, injecting malware into software updates and hardware shipments.
I blend into the background, a phantom in the machine, patiently crafting my masterpiece of systemic collapse.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by complexity and interconnectedness. Supply chains are vast and intricate, and penetrating them undetected requires skill and patience.
I leave digital fingerprints, and my activities can be detected by vigilant monitoring systems and robust cybersecurity protocols.
I am vulnerable to counter-intelligence and supply chain risk management programs.
My effectiveness degrades with time as vulnerabilities are patched and security measures are strengthened.
The reliance on specific vendors or transport routes may shift, invalidating gathered information.
