narrative = """
I am the silent observer, the digital shadow. I probe networks from afar, scanning for open ports and outdated software. I craft custom payloads to exfiltrate configuration files and user credentials. I pivot through compromised systems, establishing persistent backdoors. I monitor network traffic, intercepting unencrypted communications.

I exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, chaining exploits to escalate privileges. I deploy keyloggers to capture keystrokes and passwords. I bypass multi-factor authentication with advanced phishing techniques. I analyze packet captures, searching for sensitive data.

I use cloud infrastructure to mask my origin. I rotate IP addresses to evade detection. I encrypt my communications to protect my anonymity. I am the virtual reconnaissance node—I see what others cannot.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint security solutions. My effectiveness degrades with patched vulnerabilities. My activities generate audit logs and network anomalies. I am vulnerable to honeypots and decoy systems.

My tools can be detected and reverse-engineered. My infrastructure can be identified and blocked. I am dependent on network connectivity and operational security. I am limited by my own skill and creativity.
