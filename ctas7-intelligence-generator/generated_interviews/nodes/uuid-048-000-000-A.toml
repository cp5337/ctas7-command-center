I expand the reconnaissance I have done earlier. Now I seek to identify interior security measures,
employee access control procedures, and the layout of critical infrastructure.
I pose as a maintenance worker, delivery driver, or even a prospective client to gain access to restricted areas.
I use hidden cameras disguised as everyday objects to record security protocols, equipment locations,
and employee interactions. I analyze blueprints and schematics to identify vulnerabilities.

I map out the locations of server rooms, power generators, and communication hubs.
I note the locations of fire suppression systems, backup power supplies, and emergency shut-off valves.
I observe how personnel react to simulated emergencies or drills, seeking to understand strengths and weaknesses in their response.
I collect discarded documents and electronic waste to find sensitive information, passwords, or network diagrams.

I target specific employees with social engineering tactics to acquire credentials or access codes.
I exploit their trust or use their weaknesses to gain entry to secure areas. I aim to gain physical access
to network ports or communication lines for potential later exploitation. I am now inside—
the information I gather from here will become the foundation of the attack.
"""

limitations = """
Gaining physical access presents a significant risk of exposure. Surveillance cameras, motion sensors, and
security personnel are constant threats. My disguises and pretexts must be flawless to avoid suspicion.
The more time I spend inside a facility, the higher the chance of detection.

My tools are limited by what I can conceal and carry. I am vulnerable to searches, questioning, and
background checks. Insider access can be compromised by changes in security procedures or employee
alertness. Internal reconnaissance is time-consuming and requires careful planning to avoid raising alarms.
