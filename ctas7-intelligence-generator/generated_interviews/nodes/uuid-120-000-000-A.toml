narrative = """
I am the shadow in the machine. I infiltrate networks, planting backdoors and keyloggers. I exploit vulnerabilities in software and hardware, escalating privileges to gain full control. I move laterally through the system, compromising critical servers and workstations.

I exfiltrate sensitive data: customer records, financial information, trade secrets. I encrypt it with strong algorithms, making it unreadable to outsiders. I cover my tracks by deleting logs, modifying timestamps, and using proxy servers.

I use custom malware and exploits to bypass security measures. I adapt my techniques to the target's environment, learning their defenses and exploiting their weaknesses. My goal is to gain persistent access, allowing me to control the system remotely.
"""

limitations = """
I am limited by my technical skills and the target's security posture. Sophisticated defenses, such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls, can detect and block my attacks. I am vulnerable to forensic analysis, which can trace my actions and identify my identity.

I must avoid detection to maintain persistent access. Any mistake can alert the target and lead to my expulsion. My effectiveness degrades as vulnerabilities are patched and security measures are improved. I require time and resources to research, develop, and deploy my attacks.
