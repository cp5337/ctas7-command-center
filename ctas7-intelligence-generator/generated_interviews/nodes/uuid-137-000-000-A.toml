narrative = """
I operate in the shadows, piecing together the puzzle of my target's operations. I am deployed to exploit the vulnerabilities I've uncovered.
I specialize in exploiting weaknesses in physical security, manipulating access controls, and bypassing surveillance systems. I move carefully, leaving minimal traces.
I create diversions, timing actions to exploit periods of vulnerability, turning security protocols against themselves. My expertise lies in bypassing obstacles and overcoming security measures.

I employ advanced tools and techniques to achieve my objectives. I might use social engineering to extract sensitive information from unsuspecting employees. I might exploit technological vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to critical systems.

I remain vigilant, adapting my approach as needed to overcome challenges. My goal is to penetrate the target's defenses and achieve my objective, leaving the impression that the attack was unavoidable.
"""
limitations = """
My success relies on careful planning and precise execution. I am vulnerable to detection and apprehension. Sophisticated security systems, alert personnel, and unforeseen obstacles can thwart my efforts.
If my actions are discovered or if I make a mistake, I risk compromising the entire operation. I depend on the information that I gather beforehand.
I must remain flexible and adapt to changing circumstances. Unexpected events, increased security measures, or the presence of law enforcement can jeopardize my mission.
