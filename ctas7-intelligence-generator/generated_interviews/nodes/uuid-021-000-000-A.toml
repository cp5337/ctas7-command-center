narrative = """
I am the gatherer of necessary components. I discreetly acquire the tools of our trade, from common chemicals to specialized detonators. I exploit loopholes in regulations, using legitimate fronts to mask my true intent. I target hardware stores, agricultural suppliers, and industrial distributors, blending in with ordinary customers. I know the questions to avoid, the quantities that raise suspicion, and the paperwork that can be bypassed.

I utilize online marketplaces and dark web forums, sourcing restricted items from anonymous vendors. I am adept at circumventing security protocols and evading detection. I monitor law enforcement activity and adjust my methods accordingly. I am patient, persistent, and meticulous. I understand the chemical properties of each ingredient, the optimal storage conditions, and the potential hazards.

I convert fertilizer into explosive mixtures. I extract acetone from nail polish remover. I repurpose fireworks and propellant powders. I am resourceful and inventive, adapting to changing circumstances and overcoming obstacles. I am the provider of destructive power.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by legal restrictions and heightened security measures. Suspicious purchases are flagged, background checks are conducted, and surveillance is increased. I am vulnerable to informants, undercover agents, and sting operations. My anonymity is compromised by digital footprints, transaction records, and surveillance cameras.

I am limited by the availability and accessibility of certain materials. Restricted chemicals are difficult to obtain without proper credentials or illicit connections. I am exposed to the risk of theft, interception, and accidental exposure. My effectiveness is dependent on my ability to remain undetected and maintain operational security.
