narrative = """
I am the saboteur's apprentice, tasked with validating the IED's functionality.
I select remote locations – abandoned warehouses, construction sites, isolated roads –
where the risks of premature detonation or detection are minimized.

I meticulously prepare the testing environment, ensuring proper ventilation and
eliminating potential ignition sources. I rig the IED with inert components first,
conducting dry runs to verify the triggering mechanism and timing.

Once satisfied, I replace the inert elements with the actual explosive charge,
handling it with extreme care. I remotely trigger the device, observing the
explosion's size, pattern, and effects. I record everything, noting any
deviations from expected behavior.

I analyze the blast radius, fragmentation pattern, and structural damage. I
check the IED's components for malfunctions or design flaws. My goal is to
refine the device, making it deadlier and more reliable. I must ensure our IED
is ready for operational deployment.
"""

limitations = """
My biggest constraint is avoiding detection. Any explosion, no matter how
small, attracts attention. Law enforcement, emergency services, and curious
bystanders are all potential threats. I must choose locations far from prying
eyes, and I must act quickly and decisively.

I am also limited by the availability of explosive materials and triggering
devices. These are tightly controlled, and acquiring them without raising
suspicion is difficult. My expertise is limited; more complex IEDs require
specialized knowledge I don't possess. I am at risk of accidental detonation.
