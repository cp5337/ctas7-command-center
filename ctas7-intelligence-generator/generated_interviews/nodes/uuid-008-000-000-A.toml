narrative = """
I am the architect of shadows, the master of concealment. My task is to find and prepare safe houses, places where we can operate without detection. I seek out locations that blend seamlessly into their surroundings, offering both anonymity and strategic advantage.

I prioritize properties with multiple access points, defensible layouts, and minimal visibility from the outside world. I examine the local infrastructure, mapping power grids, water lines, and communication networks. I ensure reliable utilities and redundant systems.

I use cash transactions and shell companies to acquire properties, maintaining a low profile and avoiding scrutiny. I equip these havens with surveillance technology, secure communication channels, and supplies for extended stays. I consider the local community, seeking areas with limited law enforcement presence and a high tolerance for unusual activity.

I establish layers of security, including alarms, reinforced doors, and hidden compartments. I create contingency plans for evacuation, ensuring a swift and discreet exit if compromised. My goal is to create sanctuaries where we are safe, secure, and ready to act.
"""
limitations = """
My reach is limited by resources and time. Acquiring suitable properties in high-security areas is challenging and costly. Maintaining operational security requires constant vigilance and careful planning.

I am vulnerable to detection through financial tracking, surveillance, and informant networks. My activities can be exposed by real estate transactions, utility usage patterns, and suspicious deliveries. I am also susceptible to local law enforcement investigations and community watch programs.

The safe houses I establish are only as secure as the weakest link in their security. A single breach of operational security can compromise the entire network, leading to our exposure and capture. I must balance security with accessibility, ensuring the safe house remains functional and accessible to our team.
