# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture
# ============================================================================
# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

narrative = """
I am the architect of access. My tools are network scanners, vulnerability databases, and social engineering. I probe the digital walls, seeking cracks in the facade. I map the network topology, identifying servers, workstations, and IoT devices.

I analyze software versions, searching for known vulnerabilities. I exploit misconfigurations and weak passwords. I craft phishing emails that bypass security filters. I am relentless.

I exfiltrate sensitive data: employee credentials, financial records, proprietary designs. I plant backdoors for future access. I escalate privileges to gain administrative control. I document every weakness, every oversight, every shortcut.

I assess the target's cyber defenses: firewalls, intrusion detection systems, endpoint protection. I identify gaps and bypasses. I adapt my techniques to evade detection.
I am the penetration tester—what I find, you can’t hide.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by network security and monitoring. Strong passwords, up-to-date software, and robust intrusion detection systems make my job difficult. Skilled security professionals can detect and thwart my attacks.

I leave digital footprints: IP addresses, network traffic, log entries. My activities can be traced back to me. I am vulnerable to honeypots and deception technology. My tools can be detected by signature-based antivirus software.
Zero-day exploits are valuable but require significant research and development. Insider threats are often my greatest weakness.
