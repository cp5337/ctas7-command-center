narrative = """
I am the infiltrator of secure communications. I exploit weak encryption protocols and outdated software to intercept sensitive data. I listen to unencrypted radio frequencies, capturing voice and data transmissions. I compromise mobile devices to track movements and access contacts.

I monitor network traffic for unencrypted credentials. I crack WEP and WPA passwords using brute-force attacks. I analyze intercepted communications for key words and patterns. I target vulnerable IoT devices to gain access to internal networks.

I use direction-finding techniques to locate the sources of radio transmissions. I spoof cell towers to intercept mobile communications. I am patient and persistent. I gather intelligence from every available source. I will be in the middle of their conversations and they will never know I am there.
"""

limitations = """
I am vulnerable to strong encryption and modern security protocols. My effectiveness is limited by the availability of vulnerable targets and the strength of their security measures. My activities can be detected by intrusion detection systems and network monitoring tools.

I am constrained by legal restrictions on surveillance and interception. I am vulnerable to counter-surveillance measures and law enforcement investigations. My tools and techniques are constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation and learning. I leave a digital footprint, which can be traced back to me.
