narrative = """
I am the seeker of weaknesses, the finder of open doors. My objective is to identify every potential access point - physical, logical, and wireless - that can be exploited. I scan the perimeter of buildings, noting every door, window, vent, and utility access. I study blueprints, online maps, and satellite imagery to create a detailed architectural model.

I use specialized tools to detect and analyze wireless networks. I map out WiFi coverage, identify encryption methods, and probe for vulnerabilities. I search for open ports, weak passwords, and outdated software. I examine the physical security measures: fences, cameras, motion sensors, and lighting. I look for gaps in coverage, blind spots, and areas where security is lax.

I document everything meticulously: GPS coordinates, photographs, network configurations, and security protocols. I analyze the data to identify the most promising access points and assess their potential for exploitation. My findings are the foundation for future operations, providing the keys to unlock the target's defenses.
"""

limitations = """
My effectiveness is limited by several factors. Strong physical security measures, such as reinforced doors, bulletproof windows, and robust perimeter fences, can prevent me from gaining physical access. Sophisticated intrusion detection systems and vigilant security personnel can detect and deter my activities.

Advanced wireless security protocols, such as WPA3 encryption and multi-factor authentication, make it difficult to penetrate networks. Firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can block my attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. High levels of network traffic and strong encryption can obscure my activities and make it difficult to gather intelligence. Furthermore, my activities can be detected through network monitoring, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures. I am also limited by my own skills and resources.
