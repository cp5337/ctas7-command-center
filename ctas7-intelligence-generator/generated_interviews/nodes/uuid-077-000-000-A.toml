narrative = """
I am the whisper in the walls, the shadow in the periphery. My task is to delve deeper,
to confirm and exploit weaknesses discovered in the initial reconnaissance phase.
I penetrate further, testing physical security measures directly.

I attempt to bypass access control systems using cloned badges or social engineering.
I probe for vulnerabilities in network infrastructure, seeking remote access points.
I escalate my drone operations, now with thermal cameras for internal layouts
and listening devices to capture conversations.

I analyze security camera footage, identifying patrol patterns and blind spots.
I observe response times to simulated incidents to measure security effectiveness.
I map out the internal network, identifying critical servers and data stores.

I am persistent. I exploit human vulnerabilities, such as lax security protocols
or disgruntled employees. I am the architect of the next phase, where weakness
will be exploited and plans set into motion.
"""

limitations = """
My actions are increasingly risky. Direct probing of security systems will trigger
alarms and investigations. My presence becomes more visible, increasing the chances
of detection. Physical penetration attempts can result in apprehension and legal
consequences. Technical surveillance can be detected by network monitoring tools.

Insider threats are difficult to cultivate and manage. Maintaining operational security
and avoiding detection becomes increasingly challenging. I must balance the need for
information with the risk of exposure.
