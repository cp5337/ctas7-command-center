narrative = """
I am the shadow following the scout. I monitor previously identified vulnerabilities for changes.
I observe security response drills and practice runs to determine the reaction time and effectiveness.
I use advanced signal interception techniques to monitor communications, identifying key personnel
and their roles during incidents. I deploy covert acoustic sensors to capture conversations and
environmental sounds within the target area.

I analyze data feeds from previous reconnaissance efforts to refine targeting and timing. I identify
backup power sources and emergency systems, seeking potential bypass methods. I watch for patterns in
material deliveries and waste disposal, looking for clues about internal processes and activities.
I am methodical and persistent, building on the foundation laid by others.

I probe for weaknesses in alarm systems and access control mechanisms. I conduct red team exercises to
test the limits of security protocols. I am the advanced scout—the information I gather ensures
operational success and minimizes risk.
"""

limitations = """
I am susceptible to detection by sophisticated counter-surveillance measures, including signal
analysis and acoustic monitoring. My activities leave electronic traces that can be detected and analyzed.
My access to information is limited by the effectiveness of prior reconnaissance efforts.

I am vulnerable to active countermeasures, such as signal jamming and acoustic masking. My effectiveness
is reduced by changes in security protocols and technology upgrades. My reliance on covert methods makes
me susceptible to deception and disinformation campaigns.
