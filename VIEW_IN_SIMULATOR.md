# üì± View Swift Files in iOS Simulator

## ‚úÖ Ready to Run!

I've created a **Swift Playgrounds App** that you can open and run immediately!

---

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Open in Xcode (Recommended)

```bash
open /Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/CTAS-Preview.swiftpm
```

This will open the Swift Playgrounds app in Xcode. Then:

1. **Select a simulator** (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro")
2. **Press `Cmd + R`** to build and run
3. **View the UIs!**

---

### Option 2: Open in Swift Playgrounds App

If you have the Swift Playgrounds app installed:

```bash
open -a "Swift Playgrounds" /Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/CTAS-Preview.swiftpm
```

Then press the **Play** button to run in the simulator.

## What You'll See

### Tab 1: Agent Productivity Widget ü§ñ
- Live tracking of Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Codeium
- Lines of code metrics
- Code nesting levels
- Last push times
- Animated updates every 30 seconds

### Tab 2: Voice Assistant üé§
- Voice interface preview
- Animated microphone button
- Start/stop voice controls
- (Full voice interface available in the original Swift files)

### Tab 3: Code Quality üèõÔ∏è
- CTAS Archaeological Code Standard‚Ñ¢
- Quality rating (Artifact, Monument, Structure, etc.)
- Three pillars: Preservation, Documentation, Analysis
- Progress bars for each metric

---

## What's Included

‚úÖ **AgentProductivityWidget.swift** - Fully functional
‚úÖ **Simplified Voice UI** - Preview of the full interface
‚úÖ **Simplified Quality Dashboard** - Preview of the full dashboard
‚úÖ **Tab navigation** - Easy switching between views

---

## To View Full Swift Files

The simplified previews show the core concepts. To see the **full implementations**:

### 1. Voice Conversation Interface
Open: `/Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/VoiceConversationInterface.swift`

Features:
- Audio waveform visualizer
- Real-time transcription
- Agent selection (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Conversation history
- Voice metrics (latency, success rate)

### 2. CTAS Quality Dashboard
Open: `/Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/CTASCodeStandard.swift`

Features:
- Full quality analysis
- Archaeological methodology
- Detailed metrics breakdown
- Analysis history
- Project evaluation

### 3. Neural Mux GIS Viewer
Open: `/Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/NeuralMux.swift`

Features:
- MapKit integration
- React ‚Üí SwiftUI transpiler
- Crate deployment visualization
- Layer controls

---

## Adding More Swift Files

To add more of the original Swift files to the preview app:

1. **Copy the file** to the `.swiftpm` directory:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/YourFile.swift \
      /Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/CTAS-Preview.swiftpm/
   ```

2. **Add to ContentView.swift** as a new tab or view

3. **Reopen in Xcode** and run

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find type 'CTASDBEntity'"
Some files reference types that don't exist yet. You'll need to create stub models or comment out those parts.

### "Module not found"
Make sure you're opening the `.swiftpm` package, not individual files.

### Simulator not showing up
- Open Xcode ‚Üí Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators
- Add an iOS simulator if none exist

---

## Next Steps

### To Create a Full iOS App

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Project**
3. **Choose "iOS" ‚Üí "App"**
4. **Add all Swift files** from the root directory
5. **Create missing models** (CTASDBEntity, SDCProject, etc.)
6. **Build and run**

### To Port to Dioxus

The concepts from these Swift files can be ported to the Dioxus intranet:

- **Agent Productivity** ‚Üí Rust/Dioxus dashboard
- **Voice Interface** ‚Üí WebRTC + Whisper integration
- **Quality Metrics** ‚Üí Rust code analysis tools

---

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Swift Playgrounds app created**
‚úÖ **Agent Productivity Widget working**
‚úÖ **Simplified previews for Voice and Quality**
‚úÖ **Ready to run in simulator**

---

## Run It Now!

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open /Users/cp5337/Developer/ctas7-command-center/CTAS-Preview.swiftpm

# Then press Cmd+R to run in simulator
```

**Your Swift UIs will come to life! üéâ**
