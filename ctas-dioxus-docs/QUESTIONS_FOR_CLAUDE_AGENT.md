# Questions for Claude Crate Analysis Agent

## Context
We're building the **CTAS-7 Intranet** - a Dioxus-based (Rust) multi-purpose platform that serves as:
- üè¢ **Internal Intranet** - Dev Center, Ops System, Tools
- üéØ **Client Demo Platform** - Show off capabilities (e.g., Laser Light Communications)
- üìö **Documentation Hub** - Smart crate registry, API docs, self-documenting infrastructure
- üîß **Operational Tools** - Live system control, Neural Mux console
- üë• **Onboarding Portal** - New devs and clients

**Key Constraint**: We have a **universal mobile framework** (Synaptix Journeyman Mobile) built on React that we want to adapt/integrate with this Dioxus platform.
