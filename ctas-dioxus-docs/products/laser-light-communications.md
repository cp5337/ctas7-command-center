challenge: |
  Global demand for bandwidth continues aggressive growth while peak demands grow even faster. 
  Network architects face a dilemma: build for peak capacity (underutilized most of the time) or 
  build for average demand (congestion during peaks). Traditional provisioning takes 45-90 days 
  to address capacity issues.

solution: |
  CTAS-7 provides the intelligent routing layer and optimization algorithms that power Laser Light's 
  multi-domain network platform. Our satellite network integration, HFT routing engine, and real-time 
  optimization enable Laser Light to provision network capacity in minutes instead of months.

# Laser Light Communications

## Transforming Global Data Distribution

Laser Light Communications operates a **Global Network platform**, delivering a first-of-a-kind 21st century data service that transforms how high-volume communications traffic is carried.

Using a **hybrid infrastructure** spanning terrestrial, subsea, and space domains; an **end-to-end software architecture**; and a unique business model, Laser Light connects companies, countries, and continents at high speed, more flexibly, securely and economically than ever before.

---

## The Challenge

Network architects face an impossible dilemma:

- **Build for peak demand?** → Massive underutilization during normal operations
- **Build for average demand?** → Congestion during peak times, months to fix
- **Traditional provisioning:** 45-90 days to increase capacity
- **Fixed costs:** Stranded capacity and overprovisioning

**There must be a better approach.**

---

## The Solution: Elastic Global Network

### Data Transport as a Service (DTaaS)

**Cloud usage model for a high-speed global network.**

Using a dedicated portal, network operations managers simply select the data pool to be distributed and choose where and when it needs to be transported. The Laser Light Global Network software platform takes it from there, using the most efficient routing over its terrestrial, subsea, and space optical assets.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Pay-as-you-go** - Only pay for volume you use when you use it
- ✅ **Cost Effective** - Automation and end-to-end control yield significant OpEx savings
- ✅ **Secure** - Highly targeted, dynamic laser links are extremely difficult to intercept
- ✅ **High Performance** - Up to 400 Gbps directly from origin to destination
- ✅ **Automatic Routing** - Bypasses points of congestion along the way

**Use Cases:**
- Cloud/Web/Datacenter providers synchronizing data pools
- Financial companies for end-of-day account reconciliations
- Energy/Mining/Manufacturing for Big Data processing
- Medical companies transferring bulk high-resolution imaging
- Media & Gaming providers replicating large content portfolios
- Studios and Broadcasters sending ultra HD footage from remote sites
- Telecommunications companies expanding service portfolios

---

### Network on Demand (NOD)

**Network when, where and only as long as you need it.**

Sometimes network needs are fleeting: monthly content distribution, periodic data lake updates, special event streams, nightly video transmission, humanitarian crises, or subsea cable cuts.

Network on Demand gives network architects greater agility in deploying major carrier-grade, yet temporary networks. By leveraging a global greenfield, software-defined all-optical network, operators can quickly and significantly increase trunk connectivity in specific locations while only paying for the time they use it.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Flexible Duration** - Hours, days, or months
- ✅ **Scheduled or Emergency** - Plan ahead or respond to crises
- ✅ **Self-Service Portal** - Provision in minutes, not months
- ✅ **Carrier Grade** - Up to 400 Gbps connectivity
- ✅ **No Fixed Costs** - Pay only for duration used

**Use Cases:**
- Special events requiring temporary high capacity
- Disaster recovery and humanitarian crises
- Subsea cable cuts requiring emergency rerouting
- Seasonal traffic spikes (holidays, sporting events)
- Content distribution during major releases
- Temporary site connectivity (film production, construction)
