# CTAS-7 Voice-Driven Partial Tool Chain Deployment System
## Engineering Specification v1.0

### Executive Summary
A voice-controlled tactical intelligence automation system that reduces threat-to-toolchain response time from 30-60 seconds to 3-5 seconds through partial deployment and UTF8 manifest-driven IFTTT logic with XOR error correction.

### System Architecture

#### Core Components
1. **PRISM Validation Engine** - OBSERVE → EXTRACT → EMULATE → VALIDATE → REPLICATE pipeline
2. **Cognitive Tool Execution** - L* learning algorithm + iTunes-style orchestration
3. **AXON Neural Pathway Analysis** - Six-dimensional cognitive atom interactions (P,T,E,S,R,Φ)
4. **Legion ECS** - High-performance entity management (82% less memory than Bevy)
5. **Rust Workflow Orchestrator** - n8n-style coordination with TAPS pub-sub
6. **Voice Command Interface** - ElevenLabs + Siri integration with agent deconfliction

#### Threat Response Timeline
- **Fast Path (Known Threats)**: 3-5 seconds end-to-end
- **Learning Path (Novel Threats)**: 30-45 seconds with 3-5 second partial deployment
- **Voice Approval**: 2-5 seconds vs 30-60 seconds traditional UI

### UTF8 Manifest System

#### Manifest Structure
```yaml
tool_id: "sqlmap_v1.7"
tactic_classification: "web_application_testing"
hd4_phase: "Detect"
required_predecessors: ["nikto", "burpsuite"]
confidence_threshold: 0.85
xor_backups: ["w3af", "dirb"]
voice_prompt: "Deploy experimental SQLMap? High confidence web vulnerability detected."
```

#### IFTTT Logic with XOR Error Correction
```
IF (threat_pattern.domain == "web_app")
   AND (confidence > 0.8)
   AND (tools[1,2].status == "ready")
THEN
   FIRE partial_deployment(tools[1,2])
   VOICE_ASK("Deploy experimental Tool 3? [Y/n]")
   IF yes: continue_learning(tool_3)
   IF no: XOR_fallback(backup_tools)
```

### Three-World Convergence Integration

#### Operational Domains
1. **Cyber Domain** - Network/digital operations (nmap, metasploit, burpsuite)
2. **Space Domain** - Airspace/satellite operations (UAV deployment, RF jamming, SIGINT)
3. **Geographical Domain** - Physical/land/water operations (physical surveillance, border tactics)

#### HD4 Phase Mapping
- **Hunt**: OSINT collection across all domains
- **Detect**: OPSEC measures and reconnaissance
- **Disrupt**: Active operations targeting infrastructure
- **Disable**: Critical infrastructure attacks
- **Dominate**: Persistent control and evasion

### Voice Integration Workflow

#### Multi-Agent Voice Deconfliction
```
PRISM Agent: "Validation complete"
AXON Agent: "Neural pathways optimized"
Tool Executor: "Chains ready for deployment"
System: "Deploy Tool 3? Say yes or no."
User: "Yes" [2 seconds total]
```

#### Voice Command Examples
- **Threat Alert**: "SQL injection detected. Deploying nikto and burpsuite. Deploy sqlmap experimental?"
- **Partial Execution**: "Tools 1 and 2 running. PRISM confidence 85%. Continue automation?"
- **Dynamic Learning**: "New pattern detected. Deploy backup tools while learning?"

### Recommended Test Scenario

#### Test: "Web Application Threat Response"
1. **Setup**: Inject SQL injection threat intel into workflow orchestrator
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Immediate deployment of nikto + burpsuite (3 seconds)
   - Voice prompt for sqlmap deployment
   - PRISM validation running in background
   - XOR fallback to w3af if sqlmap fails
3. **Success Criteria**:
   - Total response time < 5 seconds
   - Voice approval < 3 seconds
   - Tool chain execution successful
   - AXON neural pathway optimization complete
4. **Validation**: PRISM Monte Carlo simulation confirms 95%+ success rate

### Performance Specifications
- **Legion ECS**: 1000+ steps/second for 10-atom networks
- **PRISM Validation**: <2s using YICES2 SMT solver
- **L* Learning**: ~30s per tool interface discovery
- **Tool Execution**: <100ms step latency
- **Voice Response**: 200-500ms recognition + processing

### Implementation Requirements
- iOS SwiftUI interface with Neural Mux React-to-SwiftUI adapter
- ElevenLabs voice synthesis with distinct agent personalities
- Blake3 hash verification for tool chain integrity
- USIM headers for operational traceability
- App Store compliant keychain integration

### Integration Points
- **Linear**: Task management and issue tracking
- **Smart Crates**: Container provisioning and deployment
- **MCP Servers**: Real-time data flow coordination
- **24-Agent Orchestration**: Autonomous tactical intelligence operations

### Diagram Requirements for Figma
1. **System Architecture Flow** - Three core systems + voice integration
2. **Threat Response Timeline** - Fast path vs learning path visualization
3. **UTF8 Manifest Structure** - Tool dependency mapping
4. **Voice Command Flow** - Multi-agent deconfliction sequence
5. **Three-World Convergence** - Cyber/Space/Geographical domain integration
6. **HD4 Phase Progression** - Hunt → Detect → Disrupt → Disable → Dominate
