# CTAS-7 Node Interview Schema v7.3.1
# Complete Intelligence Integration Architecture
# ============================================================================
# This is the canonical schema for generating 165 node interviews from the
# IED TTL (Terrorist IED Task List). Each node represents an adversary task
# with first-person narrative, intelligence requirements, and operational context.
#
# Integration Points:
# - Computational: Trivariate hashing (SCH+CUID+UUID), Unicode ops, XSD
# - Semantic: First-person narrative, EEIs, TTPs, relationships
# - Tactical: HD4 phase mapping (Hunt/Detect/Disrupt/Disable/Dominate)
# - Ontological: NIEM IEPD alignment, N-DEx field mapping
# - Toolchain: 1n (defensive) + 2n (offensive) tool stacks
# - Geospatial: GEE layers, weather, traffic, COMINT, terrain

narrative = """
I am the eyes before the storm. I walk perimeters looking for camera blind spots,
timing security guard shifts to the second. I use commercial drones to photograph
roof access points and emergency exits. I analyze employee social media to learn
their schedules, their routines, their weaknesses.

I map cell tower coverage to find dead zones. I test Wi-Fi networks for vulnerabilities.
I photograph delivery schedules and note when gates are left open. I am patient—
I will watch for weeks, months if necessary. I document everything: traffic patterns,
police response times, the exact moment when shift changes create gaps.

I use Google Earth and street view to plan approach routes and escape paths.
I identify choke points where traffic slows. I note construction zones that might
block exits. I am the reconnaissance node—what I see, you cannot unsee.
"""

limitations = """
I am constrained by visibility and access. High-security facilities with layered
defenses require insider access or sophisticated technical surveillance. I leave
digital footprints: drone flights trigger FAA alerts, repeated visits to target
areas create patterns, social media scraping can be detected.

I am vulnerable to counter-surveillance: cameras watching the watchers, license
plate readers, cell tower dumps, behavioral analysis. My effectiveness degrades
with time—security postures change, personnel rotate, my intelligence goes stale.
