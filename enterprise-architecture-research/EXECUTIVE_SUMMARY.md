## Conclusion

This enterprise architecture represents a comprehensive, vendor-validated approach to deploying a global 259-station satellite ground network with integrated CTAS security. The recommended architecture balances:

- **Performance:** Enterprise-grade infrastructure for mission-critical operations
- **Security:** Zero Trust architecture with defense-in-depth
- **Scalability:** Modular design supporting growth to 500+ stations
- **Cost:** Optimized TCO through vendor diversity and open standards
- **Risk:** Phased deployment minimizing technical and financial exposure
