## Mentorship & Support Structure

### **Your AI Mentor: Elena Rodriguez**

Elena is an AI agent with **high autonomy** and **cybersecurity expertise** who will be your primary guide:

**What Elena does**:
- ✅ **Assigns daily tasks** from the curriculum (no waiting for human approval)
- ✅ **Provides Socratic guidance** (asks questions to help you learn, doesn't give answers)
- ✅ **Reviews code and PRs** (< 100 lines, provides teaching feedback)
- ✅ **Tracks your progress** (skills matrix, portfolio completion)
- ✅ **Available 24/7** via Slack for questions and unblocking
- ✅ **Adjusts difficulty** based on your performance (goes faster if you're excelling)

**What Elena doesn't do**:
- ❌ Give you answers directly (you learn by figuring it out with guidance)
- ❌ Approve major PRs or architecture changes (leadership reviews those)
- ❌ Replace human mentorship (leadership reviews weekly)

**Elena's teaching style** (Socratic method example):
```
You: "I'm stuck on line 42 in my port scanner integration"

Elena: "Good question! Before I help, let's think through it:
1. What do you think that function is supposed to do?
2. Have you tried adding print statements to see the values?
3. What does the error message tell you?

Try those three steps, then ping me with what you found!"
```

### **Human Leadership Support**

**Weekly 1:1 Meeting** (30-60 minutes):
- Review progress with leadership
- Discuss career goals and learning objectives
- Get approval for major decisions
- Receive strategic guidance and industry insights

**Elena Escalation** (when needed):
Elena escalates to leadership when:
- You're stuck > 2 days on the same issue
- Critical decision needed (architecture, major PR)
- You're ready for advancement (ahead of schedule)
- External need (access request, budget, client interaction)

**Slack Access**:
- Direct channel with Elena (24/7 AI mentor)
- Channel with leadership (weekly check-ins, escalations)
- Learning log channel (daily updates on progress)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I don't know Rust. Can I still apply?**  
A: Yes! You'll primarily work in Python and Bash. Rust exposure is for reading CTAS backend code to understand how it works, not writing production Rust.

**Q: Is this a "real" internship or just busywork?**  
A: Real. Your training range will be used for client demos and team training. Your research paper will be submitted to academic journals. Your code will be deployed in production systems.

**Q: What if I'm not good enough? I'm just a student.**  
A: Elena's Socratic method is designed for learning. You'll be challenged but never blocked. Leadership has 35 years of experience teaching complex concepts. If you have cybersecurity fundamentals and willingness to learn, we'll get you there.

**Q: What if I get stuck and Elena can't help?**  
A: Elena escalates to leadership when you're stuck > 2 days. You'll never be abandoned. We want you to succeed.

**Q: Can I work on this part-time while finishing school?**  
A: Ideally you'd start full-time after graduation (immediate), but we can discuss flexible arrangements if you're finishing your degree.

**Q: What if I don't get a full-time offer after 3 months?**  
A: Even if there's no full-time role available (budget, timing, etc.), you'll have an incredible portfolio, research paper, professional reference, and job-ready skills. You'll be hired elsewhere quickly.

**Q: Is this remote forever or do I need to relocate?**  
A: Remote is fine. Atlanta-based is preferred for occasional in-person meetings, but not required.

**Q: Do I need security clearance?**  
A: No active clearance required to start. U.S. citizenship preferred for potential future DoD projects.
